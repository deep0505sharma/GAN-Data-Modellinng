The weapons of mass destruction need to be in the control of      the government only.  Individual access would result in the      needless deaths of millions.  This makes the right of the people      to keep and bear many modern weapons non existant.    Thanks for stating where youre coming from.  Needless to say  I    disagree on every count.   You believe that individuals should have the right to own weapons of   mass destruction   I find it hard to believe that you would support a    neighbors right to keep nuclear weapons  biological weapons  and nerve   gas on his her property.     If we cannot even agree on keeping weapons of mass destruction out of   the hands of individuals  can there be any hope for us  I dont sign any blank checks.Of course.  The term must be rigidly defined in any bill. When Doug Foxvog says  weapons of mass destruction   he means CBW and nukes.  When Sarah Brady says  weapons of mass destruction  she means Street Sweeper shotguns and semi automatic SKS rifles.  I doubt she uses this term for that.  You are using a quote allegedlyfrom her  can you back it up  When John Lawrence Rutledge says  weapons of mass destruction   and then immediately follows it with     The US has thousands of people killed each year by handguns     this number can easily be reduced by putting reasonable restrictions    on them. ...what does Rutledge mean by the term I read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of massdestruction  as commonly understood  and then switching to other topics.The first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should beallowed  and then the later analysis was  given this understanding  toconsider another class. cdt rocket.sw.stratus.com     If you believe that I speak for my company  OR cdt vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors Packet...   doug foxvogdouglas.foxvog vtt.fi',\n",

David  I had a look at your posting again and I see what you mean   I was so intent on explaining how Jung thought we could be more moral than God that I overlooked your main line of thought.  You seem to be saying that  God being unknowable  His morality is unknowable.Yep  thats pretty much it. Im not a Jew but I understand that this is theJewish way of thinking. However  the Jews believe that the Covenant betweenYHWH and the Patriarchs  Abraham and Moses  in this case  establishes a MoralCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundariesfall  though.As I understand it  the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that wasrequired  whereas the Pharisees  the ancestors of modern Judaism  believed thatthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required Morality in all its nuances    Talmud .The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface betweenMan and YHWH  for a Jew or Christian  and does not necessarily indicateanything about YHWH outside of that relationship  although one can speculate .  The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created in His image  so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we are supposed to live by Christs example  you would be hard pressed to argue that God is a  do what I say  not what I do  kind of guy.The trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the  createdin His image  means. Ive heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart ifone wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation  to mix metaphorsunashamedly   As to living by Christs example  we know very little aboutJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers  and some very small references from comtemporary historians.Revelation aside  one can only  know  Christ second hand or worse.This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity  although it may seem that wayinitially   the point I m trying to make is that we only really have the Bibleto interpret  and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is whereFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.  Metaphysically  if there are multiple moral codes then there is no Absolute moral code  and I think this is theologically questionable.No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiplemoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode. As an example  a parent may tell a child never to swear  and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is  wrong . Now  the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar  where there are no children . The  wrongness  here is ifthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is  inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent  and may be a parent later in life  butyou get the gist of it  Incidentally  the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older  see Piaget  and learns a morality of his own.David.   On religion  Oh  where is the sea    the fishes cried As they swam its clearness through.',\n",

Description of  External Tank  option for SSF redesign deleted  Mark proposed this design at Joe Sheas committee in Crystal City  and he reports that he was warmly received.  However  the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.Yo Ken  lets keep on top of things  Both the  External Tank  and Wingless Orbiter  options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Todays  4 23  edition of the New York Times reportsthat OConnor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped  such as using the  giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles   and building a  station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed. Currently  there are three options being considered  as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday  and as reported intodays Times .Option  A    Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC.  As an aside there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC  JSC  and LaRC supportingthe SRT  Station Redesign Team  in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on site at these locations  helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.  Key features of thisoption are      Uses  Bus 1   a modular bus developed by Lockheed thats     qualified for STS and ELVs. The bus provides propulsion  GN C     Communications    Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.     A  Power Station Capability  is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an  arrow mode  to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.     Human tended capability  as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man tended capability  is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module  docking ports are added for the International     Partners labs  taking the place of the nodes on SSF . The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability   EVA capability.     International Human Tended. Add the NASDA   ESA modules  and     add another 20 kW of power     Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module      the U.S. habitation module  and an ACRV  Assured Crew Return     Vehicle .Option  B    Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option  B  team is based at LaRC  and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design  which wehave all come to know and love   This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights  so does option  A  . Also  the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit for both options  A  and  B .The build up occurs in six phases      Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter Spacelab  when     it visits.     Man Tended Capability  Griffin has not yet adopted non sexist     language  is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed  and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.     Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights  by     keeping one Orbiter on orbit to use as an ACRV  so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on orbit   the ACRV  and the     second one that comes up for Logistics   Re supply .     A  Two Fault Tolerance Capability  is achieved after 14 flights      with the addition of a 2nd power module  another thermal     control system radiator  and more propulsion modules.     After 20 flights  the Internationals are on board. More power      the Habitation module  and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as is in this option  with the exception of the data management system  which has majorchanges.Option C   Single Core Launch Station.This is the JSC lead option. Basically  you take a 23 ft diametercylinder thats 92 ft long  slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines onthe backside  put a nose cone on the top  attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocketmotors  and launch the can. Some key features are     Complete end to end ground integration and checkout    4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels    body mounted radiators  which adds protection against    micrometeroid   orbital debris     2 centerline docking ports  one on each end     7 berthing ports    a single pressurized volume  approximately 26 000 cubic feet     twice the volume of skylab .    7 floors  center passageway between floors    10 kW of housekeeping power    graceful degradation with failures  8 power channels  4 thermal    loops  dual environmental control   life support system     increased crew time for utilization    1 micro g thru out the core module',\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota CelicaGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift   a more exotic car.  Front runnersincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924  1987 model years .I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal  too  of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was lessmoney and had more features and performance   almost a personal luxurycar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924  but idecided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way.  I askedabout what would happen to my rate with either car.  If you buy the Supra  your rate classification will be the same asthe Celica  the 85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for thatyear was rated as one of the safest cars   with a slight increase becausethe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower risk division will continueto handle your account.  If you buy the Porsche 924  well have to change you to the standard higher  rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go witha 944  its another story again   well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that.   But the Supra is much faster than the 924  and the 924 is actuallyfaster than the  standard  944.  That doenst make sense.   Thats what the book says.  We dont insure Corvettes  either.  Forsome reason  the underwriters consider Supras   and their drivers  as very traditional and conservative.  I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porschedealer had a nice salesman to get me interested  but a tough high pressureguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments  it would have takena year longer to pay for the Porsche  plus its higher insurance.  Iconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of autotheft.

I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that    are ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylinders    that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the    actual purpose of those things are . I hear that theyre called    Cooling Towers but what the heck do they cool  Great Explaination  however you left off one detail  why do you always see them at nuclear plants  but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle  whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water.  As I recall the water isnt as hot  thermodynamically  in many fossil fuel plants  and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination.       Actually  fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants.   Theres a gripe in the industrythat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology .  So itsmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the systemas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.         Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers  but theyusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water  not most of theway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air  as one Canadian official  asked about  thermal pollution  de icing a river  said   Up here  we view heat as a resource .         Everybody runs closed cycle boilers.  The water used is purified of solids  which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing whenthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it  so the boiler water is recycled.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn Nagle',\n",

I need to buy the front panel of a Sony XR U770 car stereo.   I was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable front panels were to make the radio useless  and thus discourage theft  that is if the  cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.   If those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio  originally costs  or even sold at all  then the above discouragement wouldnt be so great.  I personally would be unhappy  if I bought a radio like that  thinking that  removing the cover greatly depreciated the radios value  and the covers were sold by the company  or other legitimate source  cheaply.    The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local carstereo shop.  You will probably  definitely  have to provide the units serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I dont know the cost  but replacements have to be available to peoplewho damage the face cover  so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.As to deterring theft When I worked for a stereo shop  we referred the customer to a Sony 800number.  We would not sell the face  nor did we have them available.  Mostpeople who came in asking for the face cover  or a pullout sleave for thatmatter  would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deckthey couldnt use.

The real question is who what  started the   War. Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab   land            Huh   A war was started when several armies invaded Israel   vowing to drive the Jews into the sea.  Most Jews wanted to live in  peace  and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship.  It depends entirely on how you define war. The actual fighting largely predates the Arab invasions   after all Deir Yassin happened in midApril well before the Arab invasion. As I have said elsewhere Lt Col Lorch has said that Hagana forces were fighting well before the Arabs invaded as in months before. As for Jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely arguable. I think it is easy enough to show that the Labour party leadership had no such intention at all. As for the Arabs who stayed dont you mean those who were not expelled  Even some of those who did stay were not granted citizenship but expelled after the fighting had stopped anyway.

The Etzion group of villiages  near Hebron  had been cut off             while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were            slaughtered  cutting off the villiage.Jerusalem was under seige  being cut off from its supply route from     Tel Aviv  the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side     of that road to this day in memoriam .

A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull    the trigger again.Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....    A double action revolver  almost all of them  can be hand cocked first     but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.I cant imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....    A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again    to rotate to the next round.Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....    A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the    hammer for maximum safety  but still can be drawn and fired with an    easy motion  even one handed.Never hurts to err on the side of safety  but if youve got one of thosenew fangled hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties  its unnecessarilyredundant.  Id rather have the extra round.    Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines    on semi autos. Can be faster depending on users.Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack aroundthan magazines though.    A misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell    first  time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often    lost as you realize  hey  its jammed   before starting to do anything    about clearing it.True  but this is a training function.    Most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round    and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked  but a safety engaged. I do not consider    this safe however. You must trade off safety to get the same speed    of employment as a revolver.Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actionsare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colts forexample are quite safe to carry this way.    There are some double action semi autos out there  but the complexity of    operation of many of them requires more training.Agreed.Now that Ive shot off my mouth a bit  let me back some of this up.  Itis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesnt cost you much.  Onthe other hand  Ive had all sorts of interesting things happen over theyears.  For example  Ive had FACTORY ammunition that has had highprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from secondsto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.An auto   Jack the slide and continue.Ive had bullets come out of the case  keeping the cylinder fromturning  see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happenwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.Most revolvers are more fragile then semi autos.  There are all sortsof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun  or ablow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Manyof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a  quality  semi autotake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likelyto malfunction  but as a rule when it does  youre out of the fight.The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fallinto that category.Vincint makes many good points in this post  but leaves off the opposingview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoobs  The SemiAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense. In general  Id agree  the revolver is an excellent first gun and selfdefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time  and inclinationthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semiauto effectively as a self defense arm.Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the departmentisnt going to train them  they arent going to take the time on theirown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount oftraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably severaltimes that of a revolver.  Many cops dont bother.For myself  Id hate to be limited to one or the other.  Id rather pickwhat fits better with my personal inclination  what Im wearing that dayand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says  buy em all That said  I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking ofbuying their first defense arm is  right after taking a class  get aRuger or Smith revolver....   Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are oktoo  If this post had gone the other way  Id be arguing for revolvers.    Rick.',\n",

As Roger Lustig pointed out in aprevious response  the reason why Schott was banned from baseball wasbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner ona constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla on the other hand  was found to have mentioned this one word a single time. If he had been known to go around  criticizing homosexuals  it would be adifferent story.  Furthermore  he is merely an athlete.  He doesnt have tohire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone  the former NL umpire who isan admitted homosexual  has decided to assist in a protest before a Metsgame at Shea.  He  like you  thinks that Bonilla should be suspended frombaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a years suspension.  In my opinion thats downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said  if you startsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single timeunder whatever conditions  then youd probably have enough people remainingto play a three on three game.

Jamie Navarro pitchedseven strong innings  but Orosco  Austin  Manzanillo and Lloyd all took partin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday.

Hamilton is batting .481  whileThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The nextbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn  who has the teams only HR  at.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats  its not hard to see why the teamis 2 5. In fact  2 5 doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runs gameand giving up 6.6 game. Still  its early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense shouldcome around  but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters  Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd  Maldanado  Manzanillo  Fetters  Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place.

Near the end of this initial orbit  the Huygens    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission  the Orbiter    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and    targeted flybys of Iapetus  Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the    mission are threefold  conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere     rings and magnetosphere  conduct close up studies of Saturns    satellites  and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface.    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to    peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini  1625 1712   the    first director of the Paris Observatory  who discovered several of    Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan    Huygens  1629 1695   who discovered Titan and first described the true    nature of Saturns rings.\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission  VVEJGA Trajectory \\t                                                              \\t   10 06 97   Titan IV Centaur Launch\\t   04 21 98   Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\t   06 20 99   Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\t   08 16 99   Earth Gravity Assist\\t   12 30 00   Jupiter Gravity Assist\\t   06 25 04   Saturn Arrival\\t   01 09 05   Titan Probe Release\\t   01 30 05   Titan Probe Entry\\t   06 25 08   End of Primary Mission\\t     Schedule last updated 7 22 92     GALILEO   Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe  in transit.

Launched in late 1990  it carries particles and fields    experiments  such as magnetometer  ion and electron collectors for    various energy ranges  plasma wave radio receivers  etc.  but no camera.    Since no human built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of    the ecliptic plane  it went to Jupiter instead  and stole energy from    that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravity assist    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Suns south pole    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU  and  surprisingly  its    perihelion is about 1.5 AU   thats right  a solar studies spacecraft    thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is     While in Jupiters neigborhood  Ulysses studied the magnetic and    radiation environment.

By lack of people following religion I also include fanatics  people that dont know what they are following..d. So how do you know that you were right  Why are you trying to shove down my throat that religion causes horrors. It really covers yourself  something false to save yourself.  Peace   Bobby Mozumder I just thought of another one  in the Bible  so its definately not becauseof  lack  of religion.  The Book of Esther  which I read the other day forother reasons  describes the origin of Purim  a Jewish celbration of joyand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75 000 people werekilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about  you couldnt swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice peaceful solution.   Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring tomind...I agree with Bobby this far  religion as it is used to kill large numbersof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originallyintended for.That doesnt reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion  it isjust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure inthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning inreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Manypeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their ownstomache contentsthan in any absolute truth  and have therefore been driven tokill by their leaders.The point is that there are many things involved in religion that oftenlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion  an unpleasantside effect or  as Bobby would have it  the result of people switchingbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously  the results are the same.   Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiestparts of Mans history. Atheists  on the other hand  preen preen  are typically not an ideologicalsocial caste  nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is   Two groupswith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution tofurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious   namely that thesewere groups founded for reasons  entirely  their own  who used religiouspersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them morepowerfull   is trying too hard.  Basically  Bobby uses these examplesbecause there are so few wars that were  not   specifically  fought overreligion that he does not have many choices.Well  Im off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom oflittle silver butter dishes. ciao chris blask',\n",

This is   intolerable. This is about Armenia.Were you expecting a different response  Here is another one Source  K. S. Papazian   Patriotism Perverted   Baikar Press  Boston  1934           73 pages with Appendix .p. 25  third paragraph  Some real fighters sprang up from among the people  who struck terror into the hearts of the Turks.  Within a few months after the war began  these Armenian guerrilla forces  operating in close coordination with the Russians  were savagely attacking Turkish cities  towns and villages in the east  massacring their inhabitants without mercy  while at the same time working to sabotage the Ottoman armys war effort by destroying roads and bridges  raiding caravans  and doing whatever else they could to ease Russian occupation. The atrocities committed by the Armenian  volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the  Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the  fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of many Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with  accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian  guerrillas  which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of war then observed in such areas. 1   1   Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme dArtillerie de Forteresse Russe      dErzeroum   1919  p. 28.   honored me by reproducing my text.  Unfortunately  he has still not produced   the  documents  on  Jews in LATVIA.   Instead  he asks for my views on the    Turkish Genocide.   Well  that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred   other threads.  Ill let other people bring the usual charges  try to debunk   Mutlu Argic Cosar  a net wide Terrorism Triangle   and their spurious evidence.    When that does ever happen  look out the window to see if there is a  non fascist x Soviet Armenian Government in the East. Now  where is  your non existent list of scholars  What a moronian. During the First   World War and the ensuing years   1914 1920  the Armenian Dictatorship   through a premeditated and systematic genocide  tried to complete its   centuries old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by   savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from   their 1 000 year homeland. This paragraph is well written and interesting  Serdar baby  but it has nothing to do with Jews in LATVIA.  I have not presented a list of scholars.  How could you  Because there is none. I am not interested in an ex Soviet  why do you write x    Its very cute  Armenian Government  non fascist or otherwise.  You are not responding to what I am writing.  Instead  you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit.Like conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I am writing. By the way  that  bullshit  is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.For nearly one thousand years  the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland   the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914  The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years  Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.Today  x Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x Soviet Armenia.Today  x Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity.x Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

Happy the minority  Jews  which has had no Christian nation to protect it. And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in fanatic Turkey when they were expelled from Europe  especially Spain  by Saintly Christians  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects  all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up  as most Americans have  been  in the Gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition  the condition of  the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every  nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily  reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate...  He also stated that  they  Armenians  traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian  invader  that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war  and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.

In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city  of Van  whose 33 789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan  on April 28  1915  Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized  and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during  the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake.  Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state  the Ottoman Empire  and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders  army officers  and common soldiers began deserting in droves.  With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I  the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottomans enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations  who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection  and it  appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away  it might be able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian civilization. An Armenian legion was organized to expel the Turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet. 162  Thousands of Armenians from Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new  Armenian state...By mid July there were as many as 250 000 Armenians crowded into the Van area  which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than 50 000 people  Muslim and non Muslim alike. 163   162  Hovannisian   Road to Independence   p. 56  FOP 2488  nos. 127223 and58350. 163  BVA  Meclis i Vukela Mazbatalari  debates of August 15 17  1915  Babi i Ali Evrak Odasi  no. 175  321   Van Ihtilali ve Katl i Ami  Zilkade 1333 10 September 1915.

In 1941  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps  the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943  this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20 000 strong under the command of theformer guerilla leader Dro  the butcher   who was the former dictator of theshort lived Armenian Dictatorship  1918 1920  and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914 1920.An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin  which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this  the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an  encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI  when they back stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.Furthermore  as McCarthy put it  the Armenian dictatorship was granteda respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the MudrosArmistice with the Allies  October 30  1918 . The Allies had decidedto create a Greater Armenia  including the old Russian provinceof Yerevan and adjoining areas  as well as most parts of Anatoliaclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia around the Ottoman province of Adana  was to be excluded  as ithad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly setabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks  whocould be expected to oppose their plans. On April 19  1919 the British Army occupied Kars  gave civilianand military power over to the Armenians  then withdrew. The Britishplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship  even though the Russian pre war census had shown Kars Province to be over60  Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed  but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate ofthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlierin Eastern Anatolia. Murder  pillage  genocide and the destructionof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks ofKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety affordedby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore  few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One Britishsoldier  Colonel Rawlinson  who was assigned to supervise thedisarmament of Otoman soldiers  saw what was occurring. Rawlinson wired to his superiors   in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population  as  their troops  being without discipline and not being under effective control  atrocities were constantly being committed.

This verified information  supported by clear statements of reliable eyewitnesses  was also confirmed by General Odishelidje  Commander of the Russian Caucasian Army. Armenians are entering every place evacuated by Russians carrying out murders  cruelties  rape and all kind of atrocities which cannot be expressed in writing  murdering all the women  children  aged people who happen to be in the street. These barbarous murders repeated  every day with new methods continue and the Russian Army has been urged to intervene to terminate these atrocities. Public opinion is appalled and horrified.

To Acting Supreme Command   Commander  3rd Army General  The situation in the cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have  recently taken over is given below  These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the calamities and destruction which they suffered  have been destroyed  as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the  destruction suffered during the two year Russian occupation. All barracks buildings of Erzincan  the cavalry barracks in Erzurum  the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those burnt. In short  both cities are burnt  destroyed and trees cut down. As to the people of these cities  All people old enough to use weapons rounded up  taken to the Sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people  were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the  withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown  into wells  burnt in houses  mutilated by bayonets  their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses  their lungs and livers torn out  girls and women hung up by their hair  after all kinds of devilish acts. The few people who were able to survive these cruelties  worse than those of the Spanish Inquisition  are in poverty more dead than alive  horrified  some driven insane  about 1500 in Erzincan and 30 000 in Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty  for whatever they had has been taken away from them  their lands left uncultivated. The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and  Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road  have  been leveled to the ground  leaving no stone  the people completely massacred. Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions.     a long list     a long list  And still anxiously awaiting...Serdar Argic                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.

Furthermore  to take the law into ones own  hands is a criminal act  as these are matters for the state  not for  individuals.  Nevertheless  Khomeini offered a cash prize for people to  take the law into their own hands    something which  to my  understanding  is against Islamic law.Yes  this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.However  I believe there are also certain legal rulings which  in allfive schools of law  4 sunni and 1 jaffari   can be levelled againstmuslim or non muslims  both within and outside dar al islam. I donot know if apostasy  when accompanied by active  persistent  andopen hostility to Islam  falls into this category of the law. I do knowthathistorically  apostasy has very rarely been punished at all  let aloneby the death penalty.My understanding is that Khomeinis ruling was not based on thelaw of apostasy  alone . It was well known that Rushdie was an apostatelong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is noprecedent in the Quran  hadith  or in Islamic history for indiscriminantlylevelling death penalties for apostasy.I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of  fasad . Thisruling applies both within and outside the domain of anIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward wasnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.  Stuff deleted  Also  I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that  Khomeinis fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.  My  understanding is that Khomeinis fatwa was issued in response to the  _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book.  If my view is correct  then  your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a  crime in progress  is  incorrect.  I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa  from what I remember  waslevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publicationof the book. However  the charge of  fasad  can encompass anumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relationsbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa   Iran stressed thatthe condemnation of the author  and the removal of the book fromcirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis . But you are correct to point out that banning the book was notthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad arelevelled at people  not books.The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before theissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values ofsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of peoplecrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boosthis image and push the book  he was everywhere in the media. ThenMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed whileprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarilyconcerned  then climbed back on his media horse to once againattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at thispoint that the fatwa on  fasad  was issued.The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie   any actions ofRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization ofthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independantwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwaagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. Thecrime was certainly a crime in progress  at many levels  and was beingplayed out  and played up  in the the full view of the media.P.S. Im not sure about this but I think the charge of  shatim  alsoapplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrellaof the  fasad  ruling.',\n",

However  also be aware that Implementors notes are basiclyrecommendations  they are  NOT  part of the spec.  As others havenoted  many vendors  including SGI  violate this.

Kerkhoff  writes   Hi all     has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFC SAMPLES directory   after compiling the MFC libs with BWC      Seems to me  that BWC isnt able to distinguish pointers to overloaded  functions.  For example  imagine the following 2  overloaded  functions   void same_name   void     void same_name   int       After trying the whole day  I think  with BWC its impossible to take the  adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined  function pointer.   Am I right   Has anybody else had this problem      \\tthanxI think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  I dont think it is thefunction overloading at all   I do that sort of thing all of the timein BC   without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered inporting MFC to BC   is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple ofinvalid C   assumptions.I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC    butthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order inwhich static global objects are initialized  i.e. some objects aregetting accessed before they are initialized .  The problem is in theowner draw menu code somewhere   if you comment out that section  allother pieces of ctrltest work fine.Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC     The CFile  OpenFlags enum uses hard coded numbers for the open mode   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h  which differ  between MSC and BC .  All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C    assumption   that a reference to a base object can used be in place  of a reference to a derived object  true for pointers  NOT for  references .I am sure there are other problems along the same lines  but I havenot encountered them  yet .  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet  but I hopethat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not  all of MSshype about portability to other vendors compilers will be just that.         If these were my employers opinions  I wouldnt be posting them.                                                                                  Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously    R.

A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The  magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the magazine  which implies a declaration of Armenian Nazi cooperation  is attention getting. This magazine  every issue of which proves the collaboration  is historically important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.  In Nazi Germany  Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political  economic  and social rights were thus granted to them. They  occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices. The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   Aryan  and what befell them.Serdar Argic                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.

It was never a very stable package  but now it seems to crash every  day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently  ie I  cant reproduce crashes  and they are not always GPFs in the same  application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  that caused an error  but other times  windows acts very strange  and I  need to re boot.Some background   I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine  not too many  GPFs .  Then  a couple of weekends ago  I installed Lotus 123 for windows   with ATM   a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  machine is kind of strange  in that it has the IDE controler built into  the motherboard  the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS  Apparently I  was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  SAMSUNG  and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic  20 gamecard.The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl alt del still leaves  the machine kind of flaky  but turning it on and off doesnt. I havent tried taking out the RAM or the game card  because as I said  these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPFs  in the sppace of 20 minutes What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  diagnostic tools for hardware  Do you think that this might be a software  problem  ie EMM386 etc.   If it helps  i have manage to get GPFs on After  Dark  quicken  Paint shop pro.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations toClose Naval  Marine Reserve Centers To  National Desk  Defense Writer Contact  Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of          the United States  202 479 2258   WASHINGTON  April 13  U.S. Newswire     The Reserve OfficersAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense BaseRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to givesufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members ofCongress with affected locations in their constituencies  includingSen. Sam Nunn  D Ga.   chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee  ROA charged that the developers of the Navy Marine listignored demographics of the civilian population  particularly priorservice personnel.   ROAs executive director  Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman  AUS  Ret.  suggested  concern that the only plausible alternative is that theyare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reservecomponents from maintaining even todays relatively low level ofparticipation in their parent services Total Force of the future.    He asked the commission  to remove from consideration alllocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data towarrant approval of the requested action.     Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserveinstallations on this list are large enough to have a significantimpact on the community  if closed   wrote Hultman.   The majorissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a largepercentage of the existing locations.    Hultman reminded the commission   The fact that the vastmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not comeclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in thisprocess certainly supports the thesis  that these actions aresimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy andMarine Corps Reserve.   ROA also noted  that at the end of the 1960s  when the number ofNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today  there were 480Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations areapproved  there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations rangingfrom South Weymouth  Mass.  to Alameda  Calif.  28 NavalReserve Centers in Macon  Ga.  and Parkersburg  W.Va.  toMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval Marine Corps ReserveCenters include four in San Francisco  Fort Wayne  Ind. Billings  Mont.  and Abilene  Texas.   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at ElToro  Calif.  plus six others.  30    Nigel Allen  Toronto  Ontario  Canada    ndallen r node.hub.org',\n",

If thats the case then it depreciated 30.77  over 7 years or a mere 2000.

You dont forget that you   are dealing with a computer. Those scopes even with all their   neatness  still make the ickyest looking waves. Lotsa features  but   ugly output. And those are the best digitals I have ever seen. Ive   seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible.I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so muchmore about them and how they work on a scope by scope basis  andsome of the functions are typically presented  in my opinion in a counter intuitive fashion  HP has made some strides in their54600 series  IMO . Automatic setups are fine for simple repetitive waveforms  but can give you some crazy results on morecomplex events where you need to understand how the scope isactually measuring processing the event. For example  is the scopein  equivalent time  or in  real time  sampling mode  equivalent timebeing a mode where samples are built up slowly by adding a delay tothe trigger event each sweep   What was the scopes actual samplingrate at the time  How is the data being massaged after capture butbefore display  etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.Is the HP scope youre using really a 100 MHz scope  Or is it a 20 MHzsample rate scope   5 MHz single shot significance  whose frontend including S H can support 100 MHz waveforms  important forequivalent time sampling   The 100 MHz input in this case reallyonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive  or on a singlesample  when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.So  there are a lot more variables in understanding how to getuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope forgeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage forlater analysis or comparison  when the event is within the capabilityof the scope.

My friendfound out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of mymail  I quit from the mail reader   went about my business.  I must havetrashed my mail improperly  because he got on the same terminal the nextday   saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post heplaced in alt.atheism earlier that week  so he read some of them beforerealizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day  heapologized for reading my mail   said that he did not want to appear to bea snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views  didnt mind doing so  especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neitherchanged his mind nor did he change mine  as that was not the point.  Now heknows where Im coming from   now I know where hes coming from.  And allthat I can do is pray for him  as Ive always done.I believe the reason that he   I  click  instead of  bash  heads is becauseI see Christianity as a tool for revolution    not a tool for maintainingthe status quo.  To be quite blunt  I have more of a reason to reject Godthan he does just by the fact that I am an African American female. Christianity   religion have been used as tools to separate my people fromthe true knowledge of our history   the wealth of our contributions to theworld society.  The  kitchen of heaven  was all we had to look forward toduring the slave days    this mentality   second class status still existstoday.

A short sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual  they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect  Nagorno Karabag is the historic homeland and the cradle of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan  which renders the Armenian claims preposterous  even lunatic. And we still demand 1. that the x Soviet Armenian Government  as the heirs of the Armenian dictatorship  recognize the Turkish Genocide 2. that x Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people 3. that the x Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for theirheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide 4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step.

ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the formerSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold blooded slaughter ofhundreds of women and children in war racked Nagorno Karabakh.    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted morethan 450  Azeris  many of  them women and  children  who were  fleeing anattack  on their  town. Hundreds   possibly thousands   were missing  andfeared dead.    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defendingthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrifiedrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened   Thats whenthe real  slaughter began   said  Azer Hajiev   one of three  soldiers tosurvive.  The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in andstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.       They were shooting  shooting  shooting   echoed Rasia Aslanova  whoarrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way throughArmenian lines. She said her husband  Kayun  and a son in law were killedin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.    The survivors  said 2000  others  some of  whom had  fled separately were still missing in the gruelling terrain  many could perish from theirwounds or the cold.    By late  yesterday  479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue inAgdams morgue   and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of theseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial  two  were children and  three werewomen  one shot through the chest at point blank range.    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.

I think your question should be rephrased. The manyverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality  by our beliefs  have beenshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by  well meaning  Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussionof any issue  this or any other issue  requires a proof of your case as wellas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those versesand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. Wemust now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on theinterpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips withthem.Todd...',\n",

Is only in Windows. I have replaced card and am waiting on   latest drivers. Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors  in WSPDPSF.DRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup.  I had the exact same failure with the 24X and Word for Windows. A quick call to Microsoft indicated it was problem with the 24X drivers. You need to call Diamond and get the new drivers  I think version 2.03 fixes the above problem  there may be later versions that Im unaware of... Version 2.03 drivers are current.

Often when some scumbag steals the cover  that means   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case  I   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently   decided the beemer wasnt worth stealing  but did try the next night to   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.I know this is just setting myself up  but this is actually one of thethings that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts Iveheard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for MotoGuzzis and other relative  exotics  since there isnt a large demandfor parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seemsthat the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.   Jonathan E.

And all for making a quickbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. issignificantly inflated by these  quacks of a different color .  In fact  Idsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question thetrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focuson these  quacks  instead of devoting unbelievable energy on search and destroy missions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patientsthat traditional accepted medicine cannot help.                                                   Now to make a general comment on many recent posts                                                    Lately Ive seen the word  quack  bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor ordoctor wanna be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medicalsubject in a civilized manner  all he she has to do is say  quack quack  andsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll overon their backs and pee pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teachyou in medical school   how to throw your authority around Let me put it another way to make my point clear    quack  is a nebulous wordlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency   and comingfrom any medical doctor  or wanna be   where competency is expected  is realscary.But what do I know  Ive already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in thisnewsgroup as being anal retentive  and psychotic.  I look forward to morenet.diagnoses.  Hey  theyre free.Jon  Quacks R Us  Noring p.s.  may I suggest   seriously   that if the doctors and wanna be doctors onthe net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments andtheories  such as the  yeast theory   should create your own moderated group.You can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA approved  so youcan keep anal retentives like me out of it.

Since the US   is  playing Chamberlain as far as East Timor is concerned  wouldnt  that lead you to think that your argument is irrelevant and had nothing  to do with the Gulf War   Actually  I rather like your idea.  Perhaps  the rest of the world should have bombed  or maybe missiled  Washington  when the US invaded Nicaragua  Grenada  Panama  Vietnam  Mexico  Hawaii   or any number of other places.Wait a minute  Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US has never invaded Nicaragua  as far as I know .  We liberated Grenada from the Cubans\\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded  true  twice this century .  Vietnam   We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.   I guess we  invaded  Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War  eh    Mexico   We have invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times  once this century  but there were no missiles for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii   We liberated it from Spain.So if you mean by the word  invaded  some sort of military action wherewe cross someones border  you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally invaded  carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. If some nation  invades  the U.S. Virgin Islands  would they beinvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.    So from this point ofview  your score falls to 2 out of 6  Mexico  Panama . ...     Whats a  peace nik    Is that somebody who  doesnt  masturbate  over  GunsnAmmo  or what   Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik No  its someone who believes in  peace at all costs .  In other words a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria andCzechoslakia  but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And onewho would allow Hitler to wipe all  all  Jews  slavs  and political dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone. Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik   you ask   Well  it dependson what your values are.  If you value life over liberty  peace overfreedom  then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to youthan life itself  if youd rather die fighting for liberty than liveunder a tyrants heel  then yes  its  bad  to be a peace nik.The problem with most peace niks it they consider those of us who arenot like them to be  bad  and  unconscionable .  I would not have anyargument or problem with a peace nik if they held to their ideals andstayed out of all conflicts or issues  especially those dealing with the national defense.  But no  they are not willing to allow us tolegitimately hold a different point of view.  They militate and many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.   What rankhypocrisy    All to stop we  warmongers  who are willing to stand up and defend our freedoms against tyrants  and who realize that to doso requires a strong national defense.Time to get off the soapbox now.     ...

Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about      anti trust in the business world.            Since we are debating the legality of a commercial      transaction  we must use the laws governing the guidelines      and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI TRUST law says      that  while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of      investing  you can not acquire a large number of those      shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so      only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly       the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some      designs  they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.     They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.            The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the      old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi ethnic        multi religious society  accepting the jews as neighbours      was no different  just another religion. Plus they paid fair      market value  etc... They did not know they were victims of      an international conspiracy.  Im not a conspiracy theorist      myself  but this one is hard to dismiss .         Right now  Im just going to address this point.  When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land   It didnt buy it from the Palestinians themselves  because   for the most part  they were tenant farmers  fallahin    living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.  The JNF offered a premium deal  so the owners took advantage of  it.   Its called commerce.  The owners  however  made no   provisions for those who had worked for them  basically shafting   them by selling the land right out from under them.  They are to blame  not the Jews.      Amir   Why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting  was it because it was sold to Jews  was it fair to assume that the  fallahin would be mistreated by the jews  is this the norm of  any commerce  read shafting  between arabs and  jews  It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible enough to make provisions for them  but rather just leavingthem to their fate.  Your claim that the Lebanese Syrian Landlords sold Palestine  if true  even partially  omits the fact that the mandate treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule  while Palestine under british.  Obiviously  any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would be motivated to sell  regardless of the price.The point is that the land was sold legally  often at pricesabove its actual value.  It was legal  and good business forthe sellers  though it left the Palestinians who worked the landin a poor situation.    It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews share your opinion    Do you  absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasnt written down  I dont know if others share this opinion.  It is mine and Im sure there are some who agree and some who dontThe way I see it  the fallahin were caught in circumstances beyond their control  in that since they didnt own the land they didnt have a say. Of course  now for the sake of the  greater Arab unity  the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews an act that is illegal in Jordan   but when it happened  it was just business.     All told  I did not see an answer in your response. The question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets  land  infra structure etc... . IMHO the Palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase  say in world court.  Sam          My opinions are my own and no one elsesThe purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for Jewish immigrants.  In any case  no matter what the purpose  the sales were legal  so I really dont see any grounds for contesting them.Amir',\n",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE    archive in SPACE FAQ manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly    included in this FAQ has been removed  please refer to his posting or    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions  call  407  867 INFO  867 4636  at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF     The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     kjenks gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov .    The  Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual   ASC G C 2102     says \\t During the vertical rise phase  the launch pad attitude is\\tcommanded until an I loaded V rel  sufficient to assure launch tower\\tclearance is achieved. Then  the tilt maneuver  roll program \\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\tnegative q alpha  which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain  decreased abort\\tmaneuver complexity  improved S band look angles  and crew view of\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff  MECO  target\\tin second stage.     This really is a good answer  but its couched in NASA jargon. Ill try    to interpret.    1 \\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2 \\tThen  we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere  the\\t relative wind   and the chord of the wings  the imaginary line\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge  is a slightly\\tnegative angle   a negative q alpha  .\\tThis causes a little bit of\\t downward  force  toward the belly of the Orbiter  or the  Z\\tdirection  and this force  alleviates structural loading. \\tWe have to be careful about those wings    theyre about the\\tmost  delicate  part of the vehicle.    3 \\tThe new attitude  after the roll  also allows us to carry more\\tmass to orbit  or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass  or\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\tthe case if we didnt roll   performance gain  .    4 \\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\tmaneuvers  the Return To Launch Site   decreased abort maneuver\\tcomplexity  .    5 \\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio\\tantennae to have a good line of sight signal with the S band radio\\tantennae on the Orbiter   improved S band look angles  .    6 \\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon  which is a\\thelpful  but not mandatory  part of piloting any flying machine.    7 \\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground  and the nose to the east\\t usually .  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember \\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question   Why isnt the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with   Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude    The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches    one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust  one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.   You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage  and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the  top      Orbiter side  and the  bottom   External Tank side  of the stack.  The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn Vs.   A side note  the    Saturn Vs also had a roll program.  Dont ask me why    Im a Shuttle    guy.     I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the  roll    maneuver  is really a maneuver in all three axes  roll  pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack  q alpha  within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a  quaternion   a grad level math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL  NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish  you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R  Transponder 13  C Band  72    degrees West Longitude  Audio 6.8  Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic  and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest  e.g.    shuttle missions   SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you cant get a satellite feed  some cable operators carry SELECT.    Its worth asking if yours doesnt.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press    conferences  briefings by NASA officials  and live coverage of shuttle    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying    much more secondary material  associated with SPACELINK  when missions    are not being covered.

Of course I am trying to make plans of how to spend all this extra    money.  Right now I have an 89 accord  a good car  but not real sporty      I was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around     20k on a sports car of some kind.  After thinking about it  I may have a    better idea    Ill keep the Accord until it drops and buy the car Ive    always wanted    a Corvette Stingray. My reasoning is that  8000  accord       8000  corvette    16000 is less than what I would spend anyway.        Basically  Im thinking of a late 70s  early 80s for around  7  10k.    My question is  what are good years to consider  for reliability  looks     horsepower    in that order  believe it or not  horsepower is not a main    concern  if I want to go fast  I get on my motorcycle  and what are    good prices         Also  what would insurance look like   Im male  single  23  I might    wait until Im 25 to get the car   lower insurance . Would the fact that    I mainly drive the other car lower it   Is there some type of  classic    car  or  rarely driven  insurance class for driving it under 10k miles    per year            My dad has a 66 vette and its on what you say classic insurance.       Basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving       time  which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would       probably suit your needs for limited mileage.      In addition to restricted mileage  many classic insurance carriers also requirethat the vehicle be garaged when not in use. 0.02Ericy                                                                             Eric Youngblood                                                      Bell Northern Research    _                                          Richardson  Texas 75082 _                                                                        _                                                                                                                                                 Peon w o Email privs                                                                          ',\n",

What Peter says about God is whatthe Bible says.   Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands ofyears  various people come up and testify of their experience with theliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah  a priest.  Up comesDavid  a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia  Cyrus.  Up comesNehemiah  cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew  an IRS agenttakes the stand.  Up comes Luke  an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who useto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John  a 17 year old boy.  Upcomes Peter  a fishermen.  Up comes James  the brother of Jesus himself.Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen  IRSagents  priests  Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of yearswith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself I am.  While you are listening to all this stuff  you realize thatKing David could have never known John  Solomon could have never knownMatthew  Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all thesepeople are independent witnesses  and so  you rule out collaboration.  Yetall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tellsof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience isdifferent  but each experience has enough cross over to unmistakenlyreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.What Daniel did not know about God  the 3rd Highest Official ofBabylon  God revealed to John 600 years later  but with a differentperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimonydares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witnessstestimony  even though different from those prior  consistentlydescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer  you got this seeming fanaticon the other end of the net  saying  I know this God   I am .  He hasrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus  John 8 58 .Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.

If you want to look at non christian sourcestry Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views whileblatently non christian explore where technology may be going. For example  there are some chain letters going around which claim to have been written by a Christian missionary  but which present a misleading image of the Christian religion.

All of us that argue about gyroscopes  etc.  throughly understand the technique of countersteering.Including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the waythrough a corner   The underlying physics are a different matter  and need not be taught to beginners. Agreed  Countersteering  the technique   should be taught  for only with understanding of the technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance manuvers.This is really the only thing we disagree on. Maybe we should agree todisagree   I still think  that telling newbies to steer left to turnto the right is unnecessarily confusing  when theyll do it anyway if theyjust get on the bike and ride the damn thing. 2.  I  know exactly whats happening.  Its those  other  gits that havent a clue      Me too       Understanding the physics of traction is fine   but I cannot see how  detailed theory like that has any place in a motorcyle training course.  All you need to know is that maximum traction is obtained with the tyre   just  beginning to slide against the road. Then we are in violent disagreement.  While what you state is true  it is insufficient to form a traction management policy.  Available traction increases with applied normal force  ie  traction available to the front wheel increases as weight shifts under braking forces  and correspondingly decreases at the rear.  Thus  a  technique  of applying both brakes  and easing off the rear and increasing pressure on the front  can best be learned with an understanding of weight shift and available traction.Jeez  Ed  when you started talking about traction management policies Ithought you were making some weird reference to looking after railwaylocomotives...The official line here  though I do have my doubts about it  is that thefront brake is applied first  followed by the rear brake  the idea beingthat you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. Inpractice I suspect most people do what you describe. Saying   brake until the tire just begins to slide  is next to useless advice to a newbie.  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is   It also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop.If you dont slide the tyre  you have no way of knowing whether youveachieved maximum braking or not. Im not suggesting that you should alwaysaim to brake as hard as you possibly can   but if you want to find thelimits of the machine  you have to go beyond them. In any case  for maximum braking  if  as I suggested  you aim to keepboth wheels just on the point of sliding  then youll be doingexactly as  you  suggest  ',\n",

While  anyone who would want this movie is perfectly able to convert it  themselves  I thought Id let the net know that Id be glad to mail copies  of mine out.  The movie conversion took close to SIX HOURS on my poor  little IIcx  in other words  unless youve got a Quadra  you might not want  to tie up your machine in converting this file.    The movie is a fast fly through of a fractal generated canyon landscape.   The movie is 58 seconds long  and uses the compact video compressor  i.e.   QuickTime v1.5 .  The movie looks okay on 8 bit displays  and looks  absolutely awesome on 16  and 24 bit displays.    Id be happy to mail this movie to the first 20 or so people who ask for  it.  The only caveat is you need to be able to receive a nine megabyte mail  message  the movie was stuff ited down to seven megs  but binhex ruined  that party .  If more then 20 people want this movie  then its just more  evidence that the net needs a dedicated QuickTime FTP archive site.

I got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched.  I was doing  most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and  nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.      My question is     \\tIs there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching  audio  so that there will be  NO  noise of any kind on the audio lines.      I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also  exact part  numbers company names etc. for the relays will help     Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre amp  out level signals   Also  are the clicks you mentioning the big  clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact  bounce   How are you driving the relays   TTL gate output   Switching  transistor   How are the relays connected to what you are driving     Need more specifics to answer your question      As a general rule  no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranferthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentaryopening and closing of the path.The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In highimpedance audio circuits a resistive  T  is constructed close to characteristicimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs  connected to the T  transfersthe audio.In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used  and the inputs areshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristicimpedance.Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio  a second contact is usedto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.Telephone relays are handy  because contacts can be adjusted to  Make beforebreak and Vica Versa  but I havent seen any of these for years.Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps  etc.A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive  optical isolator .. It consistsof a resistive photocell and a lamp  all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp isoff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowerspassing the audio.  Once again this device in a  T  switches the audio.  Varyingthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters andyou have a mixer Lots of luck    73  Tom                                                                                Tom Wagner  Audio Visual Technician.

Where is the evidence for my opinions   At the moment  there are just   generalities I can cite.  For example  I read that in the 20th century    the percentage of youth  and people in general  who suffer from   depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies  probably   what I was reading referred particularly to the USA .  Similarly  one   can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage   in this century in Western societies    particularly with the  sexual   revolution  of the 60s  but even before that I think  otherwise the    sexual revolution  of the 60s would not have been possible     particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently   Christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage.  I propose   that these two trends    greater level of general depression in society    and other psychological problems  and greater sexual promiscuity    are   linked  with the latter being a prime cause of the former.  I cannot   provide any evidence beyond this at this stage  but the whole thesis   seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it.       Fred Rice     a Muslim  giving his point of view.    darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   I think this is a big leap sex  depression.  One example is myself where no sex  depression     But  seriously 1  promiscuity is on a decline depression is not and 2  it might be more reasonable to say depression  promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to comefrom emotional problems  relationships  family  job  friends  andpromiscuity is used as an escape.Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than anemotional bond  I dont see a problem with sex before  not outside of marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion aswhat is expected from a married couple.

Little in the cosmic sense.Ah  in the _cosmic_ sence.. but who lives in the cosmic sence Not me  Cosmicly  we dont even exist for all practical purposes.I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life.It would just say   dont bother. Luckily for mortals  there are many sences of scale you can talkabout. In a human sence  you can have big purposes.   Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone  the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind  eventually to be turned into dust.But the influence of Aristotle  Confucious  Alexander  Ceasar andcountless others is still with us  although their works have perished.But they have changed to course of history  and while humanity exists their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing  even if theyare utterly forgotten. Mankind itself will one day perish.One day  surely.  well  unless you believe in the Second Coming  whichI do not But in that time we can make a difference.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical  without God  it is all pointless in the end.In the end. But it must be the end  until then  there is all thepoint you can muster. And when that end comes  there will be nobodyto ask   Gee  I dont think James Sledds deeds are gonna makemuch of a difference  ulitmately  ya know  .But they will have already have made a difference  great or small before the end.Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile    Most people are able to live with that  and for them little purposes  success  money  power  effecting change  helping others  suffice.Little is in the eye of the beholder  of course.   I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale  or are at least able to put it out of their minds.I dont doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. Andit does not seem to mean much to us  here  today. To me  it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely mydefinitions. Heres what I think the relevant terms are  Reality \\tThat which is real. Illusion \\tThat which is not real  but seems to be. Real \\t\\tObjectively ExistingFor  reality  to be an  illusion  would mean  then That which is real is not real  but seems to be.Or That which objectively exists  does not objectively exist  butdoes seem to objectively exist.From which we can conclude  that unless you want to get acontradiction  that no things objectively exist.But I have a problem with this because I would like to saythat  I  objectively exist  if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sumand all that.Perhaps you do not mean all that  but rather mean  Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans. Which is not so bad  and so far as I know is true.   That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.Have on. If reality is an illusion  isnt True Reality an illusiontoo  And if True Reality is spirit  doenst that make Spirit an Illusionas well If I am not distinctly confused  this is getting positively Buddhist.   That this world is a school of sorts  where we learn and grow  and our souls mature.That is one hell of a statement  although perhaps true.Do you mean to imply that it was  intended  to be so  If so please show that this is true. If not  please explain how thiscan give a purpose to anything.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes How does it do that Wouldnt the world school w  intent idea make the world a preparation forsome  greater  purpose  rather than a purpose in itself.  and takes some of the pressure off.What pressure    Its not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if youre really just here to learn.It is not necessary to be a success in human terms  unless yourgoals either include doing so or require doing so before theythemselves can be achived.Indeed  many people have set goals for themselves thatdo not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it.

Make that less than half a goal a game.  The lower quality of opponet  argument is immaterial as neither Roussel nor Soderstrom had any say in  the matter.  That was Dineens decision.So in other words  if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts outthe Penguins  thats immaterial because it was the coaches decision  Come on Joe  think about what youre saying  Who they played is VERY significant.Why they played them is whats irrelevent. A low GAA against good teamsis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing twogoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against goodteams is much  much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the contextof comparing two goaltenders.    The fact of the matter is that  despite last nights shutout  he doesnt    have what it takes. Last night was due to an inept Ranger team much more    than Roussels skill. A 3 on 1 and they dont get a shot away  A 2 on none    and one guy just passes and stops  the other guy shoots into Roussels pad     Cmon  Pete   So the Rangers were inept.  A shutout is a shutout.  During  both of Soderstroms masterpieces against Toronto  Mike Emerich was quoted  as saying he didnt think the Leafs had much offensive firepower past their  first line.  Does that make Soderstroms shutouts less impressive because of  Torontos lack of offense YES IT DOES  Absolutely.   In the context of comparing two goaltenders  .Of course  at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how youget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if youre acoach deciding between two goalies  or a GM looking to make a trade  youhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didnt see the second Torontogame  but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing inthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasnt tested. The samefor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances  one he made agreat play  the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. Ifyou were judging Roussel on that game alone  you have very little to go by.But if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the Habs  you saw a goaliestand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a  1 goalie in action. Rousseldoesnt have a game like that in him.  Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the  1 goalie  Soderstrom  was being treated for his heart ailment .  The Flyers finished November at  6 3 1 and were 9 10 4 overall.  And theres no way of knowing where the Flyers  would have finished if Soderstom wasnt wearing the oragne n black.  Im glad  we dont have to find out anytime soon either because he is one hell of a  player.  I would take him over Roussel right now  but I still think Dom has  what it takes to be the  1 guy.  He outperformed Hextall enough during the  91 92 season to make Flyers management think that way too.Dont be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing aboutRoussel  but they dont say too much on the good side either. Ive seenat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he wasto have two good goaltenders  it was Tommy this  Tommy that  and oh  yeah Dom has played well too.  By the way  what was the final card on Monday night   Team picture by any  chance FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull  really. They handed out ateam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut  but it was thesame picture they sold in the programs in mid season. Had names like Benning Kasper...  And how did the Flyers choose the fans who received  the shirts off our  backs    Winning Recchis jersey after breaking the clubs single season  point record would have been nice.  But knowing your luck you would have  won Roussels    Mostly random seat locations  some were given out by having certainautographs on the team photos. I dont like that method since Ive seenguards help out people get things like Lindros pictures  surely if theygot their hands on an autographed picture theyd hold em for their buddies.pete clark',\n",

Paul  quite frankly Ill believe that this is really going to work on  the typical trash one needs to process when I see them put a couple  tons in one end and get  relatively  clean material out the other end   plus be able to run it off its own residual power.  Sounds almost like  perpetual motion  doesnt it  Fred  the honest thing to do would be to admit your criticism on scientific grounds was invalid  rather than pretend you were actually talking about engineering feasibility.  Given you postings  I cant say I am surprised  though.Well  pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than justtugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually tryingto recover the energy from this process  which is at least trying togo the right way on the energy curve .  Now  where  did  I put thosesackcloth and ashes  I was not and am not pretending anything  I am  so  pleased you arenot surprised  though.  No  it is nothing like perpetual motion.  Note that I didnt say it was perpetual motion  or even that itsounded like perpetual motion  the phrase was  sounds almost likeperpetual motion   which I  at least  consider a somewhat differentpropposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I shouldbeg your pardon for being  too  precise in my use of language  The physics is well understood  the energy comes from fission of actinides in subcritical assemblies.  Folks have talked about spallation reactors since the 1950s.  Pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research tools.  Accelerator design has been improving  particularly with superconducting accelerating cavities  which helps feasibility.  Los Alamos has expertise in high current accelerators  LAMPF   so I believe they know what they are talking about.I will believe that this process comes even close to approachingtechnological and economic feasibility  given the mixed nature of thetrash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs ofseparating things first and having a different run for eachactinide  when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull relatively  clean material out the other.  Once the costs technological risks  etc.  are taken into account I still class thisone with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure  its possibleand the physics are well understood  but is it really a reasonableapproach  And I still wonder at what sort of burning rate you could get withsomething like this  as opposed to what kind of energy you wouldreally recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and powerwith and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces  pounds or tons  grams  kilograms  or metric tons  for you SI fans  ofmaterial and are we talking days  weeks  months  or years  days weeks  months or years  for you SI fans    hmmm  still using anon decimated time scale  I see        The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being built is that there isnt any reason to do so.

       "  210: 'Reply To  aa888 freenet.carleton.ca  Mark Baker Organization  The National Capital FreenetLines  106To what follows  our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that I could have done so  so I will confinemyself to answering the charge of illogic. In a previous article  Eugene.Bigelow ebay.sun.com  Geno  says   If I dont think my belief is right and everyone elses belief is wrong   then I dont have a belief. This is simply what belief means.  Unfortunatly  this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion. This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is  or was taught to think. It is the fundamental premis  A is not not A . If a thingis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. Weshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word  believe  however. The weak sense means I am not sure.  I believe Tom went to the library.   but he could have gone to the track . The strong sensemeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought.  I believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.   despite the fact that nature  appears  capricious and unpredictable . Christianbelief is of the strong kind.  Though Christians may well hold beliefsof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics.   Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you dont accept their teachings then you wont be  saved . Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view  but the majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic thatif Christanity is true  then Hinduism  for example  must necessarilly befalse  insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with  Christaianity.  And  as a matter of  logic   vice versa.   It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks wants. It is arrogant to claim to know what  anyone  thinks or wants  unless they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinksand wants. Especially when its based upon your interpretation of a book. Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible  but on the livingtradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantlyby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs cant both be correct. If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feettall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds  our beliefs differ  but we may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleivethat he is four foot nine  one of us  at least  must be wrong.  Its all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it Gods truth  a universal truth  or call it what you will. I dont believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and its up to you to look for and see it  through prayer  meditation  inspir  ation  dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently  it doesnt mean one is wrong and the other is right. Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken. In short  you believe that anyone whodoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED. As an example  take the question   Is the glass half empty or half full   You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct. So  for your belief to be true  does not require everyone elses belief to be wrong.Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with theknowability of truth  but simply with language. Saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is halffull  it is the same fact expressed in different words.  The wholepoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimistand the optimist express the  same  fact.  It is  of course  quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words. It is also true that they may failto understand each others words as expressions of the same beliefand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Greatscisms have occurred in just this way  and much ecumenical work hasbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which concealagreement in belief. This does not mean  in any sense  that all beliefsare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradictsome other beliefs that other people hold  after all obfuscationsof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs havebeen stripped away  some of the beliefs that some people hold must   necessarilly   be false  and it is neither arrogant nor illogicalto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct  but if Y is equivalent to not X then one of us is wrong and as longas we hold our respective beliefs  we must each regard the other as in error.

Pixie        p.s.  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists  why do you follow it blindly   \\tWhy do we follow God so blindly   Have you ever asked aphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog The answer is quite simple  the dog can see  and the blind personcannot.\\tI acknowledge  as a Christian  that I am blind.  I see but I see  illusions as well as reality.   Watched TV lately  I hear  but I hear lies as well as truth.   Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.   Remember  all that tastes well isnot healthy.  So  I rely one the one who can see  hear  andtaste everything  and knows what is real  and what is not.That is God.\\tOf course  you may ask  if I cannot trust my own senses how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth ora lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must forceourselves to believe that God knows the truth  and loves usenough to share it with us  even when it defies what we thinkwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world \\tI also do trust my experiences to some extent.  WhenI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience  because it is what my Father commands me to do  and I seethe results in the long term  I find that He has led mein the proper direction  even though it did not feel rightat the time.  This is where our works as Christians areimportant   As exercises of the body make the body strong excercises of faith make the faith strong.  \\tAs for you  no one can  convert  you.  You mustchoose to follow God of your own will  if you are ever tofollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share withyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that we have to accept your decision  although we always keepthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find outwhy we believe what we believe  I can only suggest you trypraying for faith  reading the Bible  and asking Christiansabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow tounderstand why we believe what we do  in defiance of thelogic of this world.\\tMay the Lord bring peace to you  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMalcusco         ',\n",

In terms of laws regarding individualrights  restrictions on police searches  etc...  all closelyrelated to crime  Canadian laws parallel Englands and differgreatly from those of the United States.   ...In fact  an exhaustive  seven year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver  British Columbia and Seattle  Washington... cities with roughly the same population  urban economy  geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.Actually  they do not have  roughly the same... urban economy   and extremely different ethnic composition. Over the seven year study  388 homicides occurred in Seattle  11.3 per 100 000  vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver  6.9 per 100 000 . After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations  the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle  as compared to Vancouver  was found to be 1.63.However  if you account for economic and ethnic differences the difference disappears completely  Seattles minorities arepredominatly poor  while Vancouvers are middle or upper class.The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle while the rate for poor  Seattle minorities was almost threetimes as great as for the well to do minorities of Vancouver.The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations  notone of gun control. The authors of the report also investigated  legally justifiable  homicides  self defense .  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven year study  11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred...That is a gross distortion   Self defense  does not mean killingthe attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their attacker in self defence. But such cases represent less that0.5  of the crimes prevented by armed self defence  for everycase you cite  there were over 200 other cases of self defencewhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. 0.5   by the way  is the most conservative possible figure based on the National Crime Surveys estimate of 80 000crimes prevented by armed self defence each year. Most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500 000 to 600 000.Those figures would imply less than 0.08  of sucessful self defencesinvolve killing the attacker.  So  more correctly  there over 4000  possibly as many as 25 000  cases of civilians acting in self defence  only 21 of which resultedin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor  incomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves  homicidesmake up approximately 1  of the violent crimes the studyconsidered  so the fair comparison would be 40   250 homicidesprevented and 592 homicides. Clearly  the study can not beclose to accurate  since it ignored these cases of self defence.

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of newtreatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are  blind  in various ways.  Some of theseare   o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a      placebo or the test treatment  i.e.  whether they are in the     control group or the test group.  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects     receive a placebo or the test treatment.Obviously  at the point at which the data is analyzed  one has to differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysisis quasi public  the researcher describes it and presents the data onwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects areanimals  such as mice  there were many cases of skewed results becausethose who performed the study did not  blind  themselves.  It is notconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they alreadyare  though it is important that in all respects except the one tested the control and test groups are treated alike.Russell',\n",
       "  248: 'Organization  Technical University Braunschweig  GermanyLines  93In article  65974 mimsy.umd.edu mangoe cs.umd.edu  Charley Wingate  writes    Well  John has a quite different  not necessarily more elaborated theology.  There is some evidence that he must have known Luke  and that the content  of Q was known to him  but not in a canonized form.  This is a new argument to me.  Could you elaborate a little   The argument goes as follows  Q oid quotes appear in John  but not inthe almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However  they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such  andnot an entirely different source.    Assuming that he knew Luke would obviously put him after Luke  and would  give evidence for the latter assumption.  I dont think this follows.  If you take the most traditional attributions  then Luke might have known John  but John is an elder figure in either case. Were talking spans of time here which are well within the range of lifetimes. We are talking date of texts here  not the age of the authors. The usualexplanation for the time order of Mark  Matthew and Luke does not considertheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark  and Lukethat of Matthew  and probably that of Mark . As it is assumed that John knew the content of Lukes text. The evidencefor that is not overwhelming  admittedly.      1   Earlier manuscripts of John have been discovered.   Interesting  where and which  How are they dated  How old are they   Unfortunately  I havent got the info at hand.  It was  I think  in the late 70s or early 80s  and it was possibly as old as CE 200.  When they are from about 200  why do they shed doubt on the order onputting John after the rest of the three     I dont see your point  it is exactly what James Felder said.  They had no  first hand knowledge of the events  and it obvious that at least two of them  used older texts as the base of their account.  And even the association of  Luke to Paul or Mark to Peter are not generally accepted.  Well  a genuine letter of Peter would be close enough  wouldnt it   Sure  an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would befine. So whats that supposed to say  Am I missing something    And I dont think a  one step removed  source is that bad.  If Luke and Mark and Matthew learned their stories directly from diciples  then I really cannot believe in the sort of  big transformation from Jesus to gospel  that some people posit.  In news reports  one generally gets no better information than this.  And if John IS a diciple  then theres nothing more to be said.  That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it  One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.    It is also obvious that Mark has been edited. How old are the oldest  manuscripts  To my knowledge  which can be antiquated  the oldest is  quite after any of these estimates  and it is not even complete.  The only clear  editing  is problem of the ending  and its basically a hopeless mess.  The oldest versions give a strong sense of incompleteness  to the point where the shortest versions seem to break off in midsentence. The most obvious solution is that at some point part of the text was lost. The material from verse 9 on is pretty clearly later and seems to represent a synopsys of the end of Luke. In other words  one does not know what the original of Mark did look likeand arguments based on Mark are pretty weak. But how is that connected to a redating of John    Benedikt',\n",

Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold  turned pale  and lost 60  of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasnt that heavy  I was working hard but not at 100  effort.  I waited for a few  minutes  trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises  flyes  with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set  and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  Ill take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is  still  somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal    my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.

Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders      usually 13   and theyre using more LSD and inhalants like glue    and air fresheners  says a new survey.    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds     statistically significant increases  in eighth graders use of    many drugs  including marijuana  cocaine  crack  LSD and inhalants.     We may be in danger of losing some ... hard won ground  in reducing    drug use  as a new  more naive generation of youngsters enters    adolescence   says Lloyd Johnston  University of Michigan  chief    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and    Human Services.    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade long    decline.    The study of 50 000 students shows the percentage who tried the    following in the 30 days before they were polled           8th graders    alcohol 26   cigarettes 16   marijuana 4                           cocaine 0.7 .          10th graders   alcohol 40   cigarettes 22   marijuana 8                           cocaine 0.7 .          12th graders   alcohol 51   cigarettes 28   marijuana 12                           cocaine 1.3 .    Among 12th graders  use of marijuana  cocaine and inhalants    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.      2  of eighth graders have tried LSD in the last year  up 24     over 1991.       Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982  6     tried it in the last year.    Reducing drug use among students  requires a different kind of    strategy  that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part    of an overall illness prevention plan.    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth graders    disapprove of them.     Its scary   Shalala says.   Dealers are focusing on younger  more    vulnerable kids.

While Lopez might  some  day  be a better catcher than Olson  I find it totally amazing for  you to suggest that this 22 year old with three seasons of professional  baseball is  now  better than Olson  a five year MLB veteran who is  noted for his ability to call a game  and who has a better than average  arm.  Oh  perhaps you are talking about hitting.  Well  sure  Lopez   might  hit better.  Perhaps he  probably  will.    But has there ever in the history of baseball been a 22 year old  or  younger   rookie  catcher who compared favorably among all league  catchers in terms of defense and brought a .247 bat   Wasnt it Yes  Ivan Rodriguez  last year.  Batted .260 and threw out 51  of thebaserunners.  Not too shabby for a rookie from AA.  20 years old lastyear.  Sandy Alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year   Not.  Wasnt it Benito Santiago who was supposed to be that good  in his rookie year   Not.    I can continue this thread with the others mentioned  but you get  the point.  You and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the   seasoned veterans in favor of the hot  young  rookies.  Perhaps    just perhaps   the management team of the pennant winning Braves  knows something more than you do.

Deletion     No Gregg  you cannot say A is lenient and A punishes severely in public.  Unless  of course  it is one of the exceptions implied by  almost all  matters .  That depends on the statistics and who is punished in public. If some power  for example  nothing Islamic about it  allows men to rape women five times before blowing the rapists head off in public then Id call that leniency  wouldnt you   You have given that example. It is not lenient. End of argument. And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. Itrather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal systemwithout checking if they suit the description. And wasnt the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman accordingto Islamic law     While I dont approve of it  I think both the prostitute and the customer  have the right to do what they do. In other words  punishing them is a  violation of their rights. And to punish them severely in public is just  another pointer to the hysteria connected with sexuality in so many  religions.  Believe what you like.  No  I even believe what I dont like. Can you give better answers than that Have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims     In this case  I dont see why I should accept the complex ridden views  of an oriental goatherd.  Ah  yes  I forget that the West is historically so much without sexual neurosis      Oriental goatherd   _really_ intellectual.  A fact  if memory serves. And most will see the connection between theprimitive machism in the Orient and in Islam.   If people agree on having sex it is fine. And I would assume that a  god would have a clue of what the detrimental effects of supressing it  are.  Huh  Ever heard of AIDs   Of course youll probably go on to say that God must be evil because he allows the disease to exist  bla bla .  As usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sexnor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher  the point is  a very importantpoint  the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is evenstronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. Theconsequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids.Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sexis not controlled is completely counterfactual.  And since you have brought up the point  is your god evil or not    Benedikt',\n",

Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf. The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40  Navy Times  and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class. Politically  General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues  the ECONOMY and choose to stay out of other peoples wars  Iraq  Bosnia  Somalia  we would not be in this fix.  An anyway  couldnt the jobs be replaced byimproving our domestic situation    Im not for continued deficit spending but if Clinton and Congress want to spend  Id rather they improve the infrastructure than fight other peoples wars.  In addition  more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being  required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships. The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a pork happy Congress.A novel idea   Getting away from naval bases  what about refurbishingdecommissioned Air Force bases as airports   This would be SO much cheaperthan building them from the ground up  Denvers new airport is one of the most appalling examples of pork barreling and cronyism I have seen inmy lifetime .

I doubt it.  In the medieval period  esp. 10th cent.  when Aquinas flourished  argument was a useful tool because everyone   knew the rules.   Today  when you cant count on people knowing even  the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric  a good argument is  often indistinguishable from a poor one.    The last sentence is ironic  since so many readers of  soc.religion.christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as  Josh McDowell and C.S. Lewis.I havent followed whatever discussion there may have been on thesepeople  but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and Isee no reason for embarrassment.  If you think that errors and flawedarguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker  you must dismissnearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant  any philosophy coursewill introduce you to their weaknesses.     The above also expresses a rather odd sense  of history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas day  who were  mostly illiterate  knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people  today  If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the  cream of the crop  so to speak  could read and write. If everyone in  the medieval period  knew the rules  it was a matter of uncritically  accepting what they were told.I said nothing about  the masses.   However comparing  the masses  inour day and in Aquinas day really  is  odd.  Read Ortega y Gasset onthis.Im talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night andwinning on logic and evidence  only to discover your opponent to beunaware  even intuitively  of things like entailment  let alonepragmatics .

When someone wants to buy land  and someone else is willing   to sell it  at a mutually agreeable price  then that is commerce.  It   is not a hostile action leading to war.  No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction  we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI TRUST law says that  while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing  you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly  the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs  they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi ethnic   multi religious society  accepting the jews as neighbours was no different  just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value  etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy.  Im not a conspiracy theorist myself  but this one is hard to dismiss . Right now  Im just going to address this point.When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land It didnt buy it from the Palestinians themselves  because for the most part  they were tenant farmers  fallahin  living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.The JNF offered a premium deal  so the owners took advantage ofit.   Its called commerce.  The owners  however  made no provisions for those who had worked for them  basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them.They are to blame  not the Jews.

       "  303: 'Organization  U of Wisconsin Madison College of EngineeringLines  127Hello src readers Again the misconception that Copts among other Oriental OrthodoxChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussionabout it a while ago. In article  May.6.00.34.58.1993.15426 geneva.rutgers.edu  db7n  andrew.cmu.edu  D. Andrew Byler  writes   The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism.  This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism  which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox. Then OFM comments      These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying different things its often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things  or whether they are using different terminology.  I dont think theres any question that there is a problem with Nestorius  and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical.  But Id like to be a bit wary about the Copts  Armenians  etc.  Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought. With my appreciation to the moderator  I believe that further elaborationis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issueof the Copt Net Newsletter  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople  as opposedto the western empire of Rome   the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria playedleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speakabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril  Pope of Alexandria  was the head of theEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was saidthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all theirtime in meetings. This leading role  however  did not fare well when politicsstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the EmperorMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.Dioscorus  the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled  to this interferencewas clear   You have nothing to do with the Church.   These political motivesbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451  when the Coptic  Church  wasunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches  who believed  inmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has onlyone nature  the divine  not two natures  the human as well as the divine.The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it wasportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon   In  that Council  monophysitism meantbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  Hisdivinity   and He   is perfect in  His humanity   but  His  divinity  and Hishumanity were united in one nature called  the nature of the incarnate word  which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts  thus  believe in twonatures  human  and    divine   that are   united in   one  without mingling without confusion  and without alteration   from the  declaration of faith atthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy .  These  two  natures  did not separatefor a moment or the twinkling of an eye   also from  the declaration of faithat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy .The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  ofChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly  but  theywanted to exile the  Church    to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian independent Pope. Despite  all of this   the Coptic Church  has remained verystrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from theWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusalto be politically influenced  or whether Pope Dioscurus  didnt  quite go theextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite  the CopticChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile  semantic  differences betweenall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117thsuccessor  of  St. Mark  Pope Shenouda III    To the  Coptic Church  faith ismore  important  than  anything  and   others  must know that  semantics  andterminology are of  little importance to us.   Throughout this  century   theCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. TheCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It hasremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  amember  of the all  African Council of Churches   AACC   and the  Middle EastCouncil of  Churches  MECC .  The Church    plays an  important role   in theChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  thetheological differences with the  Catholic  Greek Orthodox  Presbyterian  andEvangelical Churches. ... As a final note  the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did signa common statement of Christology  in which the heresey of Monophysitismwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe inMonophysitism.Peace Nabil          .                                                             .

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  AsAndrew Byler correctly stated it  the Nestorians and monophysites wereactually opposite parties.  The point I was making  which Nabilexplains in some detail  is that some groups that have been consideredheretical probably arent.Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups  the Alexandrians andAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptableto moderates in both camps  while ruling out the extremes.  I agreethat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the courseof the complex politics of the time  it appears that some people gotrejected who didnt intend heresy  but simply used language that wasnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to havejointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There aregroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  Thisposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are alsoa remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so calledmonophysites  there is reason to believe that the current so calledNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius fromwhat they saw as unfair treatment  but claim they did not adopt hisheresies  and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives ofthe Antiochene tradition.  clh ',\n",

Have you considered Josephus  the Jewish Historian          who also wrote of Jesus   In addition  the four gospel accounts         are very much in harmony.    Bill  I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what isprobably the weakest evidence.  What is probably the most convincing is the anti Christian literature put outby the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities ofdetailed arguments against Christianity  many of the arguments still being usedtoday.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity  not one denies theexistance of Jesus  only of his activities.  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of thegospels  especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as asource .    __L__     ___  Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub      o   kv07 iastate.edu         Iowa State University     ___  Math Department     ___  400 Carver Hall     ___  Ames  IA  50011 J  _____',\n",

My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost  why not  grapple   do all said fixes    bolt a small  liquid  fueled thruster module  to  HST    then let it make the re boost...Somebody has to build that thruster module  its not an off the shelfitem.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware  since it has to includeattitude control  HSTs own is not strong enough to compensate for thingslike thruster imbalance   guidance  there is no provision to feed gyrodata from HSTs own gyros to an external device   and separation  youdont want it left attached afterward  if only to avoid possiblecontamination after the telescope lid is opened again .  You also getto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost isdone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle  the lid stays closed forthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination fromthrusters and the like .The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do thereboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug  wellsuited to precisely this sort of job.

       "  325: 'Lines  59    Message ID   1r24us oeh agate.berkeley.edu   It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications  would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future  probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones  recordcalls without listening to them  and then post facto obtain warrantsand listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But thisstrategy wouldnt get the stuff admitted in court.   At least  notin the near term. In other words  near as I can tell  the thing that makes such evidenceinadmissable is the interception without a warrant  not the attempt tointerpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  Id be surprisedthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anythingbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.Note that that doesnt mean I think it wont be done if technicallyfeasible.  Just as Im sure many wiretaps are done now withoutwarrants  just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future start surveilance  start archiving data  trump up some probable cause decrypt post facto after the warrant is in hand  and the investigationgets a boost from data that  sadly  wont ever be presented to a jury.While Im posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting thisarchiving scenario to extremes  read  Lacey and his Friends   acollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down theslippery slope by archiving  everyghing .  But dont worry folks  itsstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants canget to it.  And by the way  well be installing cameras on all majorstreets.  Hey  this is nothing new  we already have cameras in banks andteller machines  dont we And then well pass laws requiring cameras covering  all  publicplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then well make it a crime everto be out of range of a camera  except in legally licensed privacycubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before andafter.  But  see  theres still a right to privacy.  We haventcurtailed any rights  not really.  And just think how much easier itdbe to solve crimes in such a situation  just obtain a warrant  put on aVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.And hey  nobodyll be tracking  you  or  me   no need to be self conscious.After all  if youre not doing anything illegal...Funny  though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry becamepretty much a thing of the past  somehow all this didnt elminate allcrime in the story.  And somehow  politicians got exemptions on groundsof national security  and rich corporations got exemptions for theirexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation ofcompetition.

Are they implying that Satan is omniscient   You        might try tricking them into saying that Satan is all knowing and        then use that statement to show them how their beliefs are        self contradictary.              No  Satan is not omniscient  but he does hold dominion over the earth      according to Christian theology  note  not to be confused with JWs      theology .                 What are the standard theologies on who what created Satan      and why            Orthodox Christian theology states that God created Lucifer  Satan    along with the other angels  presumably because He wanted beings to   celebrate  glorify  existence and life  and thereby  God  along with   Him.  Actually the whys and wherefores of Gods motivations for    creating the angels are not a big issue within Christian theology.      But God created Lucifer with a perfect nature and gave him along with   the other angels free moral will.  Lucifer was a high angel  perhaps   the highest  with great authority.  It seems that his greatness caused   him to begin to take pride in himself and desire to be equal to or   greater than God.  He forgot his place as a created being.  He exalted   himself above God  and thereby evil and sin entered creation.Actually  the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.Oh yeah  there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anythingmore than a snake  well  a talking one...had legs at the time  too .I dont think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best wayto show the error in theology   if they think a supernatural entitykicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into afruit that gave them special powers...well  they might not respondwell to reason and logic.

Why dont the Republicans get their act together  and say they will support a broad based VAT that would have to be visible  the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they have in Europe  and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform         The Republicans are  in general  fighting any tax increase.There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increaseincrementally.        BTW  what is different between Canadas tax and most ofEuropes that makes it  visible    and force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could be increased only via a national referendum.       This would require a constitutional amendment  and Congressenjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that. Besides  with the 2 3 majority necessary to pull that off youd have a difficult time  forcing  anything like that.  Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile... shift the tax burden from investment to consumption  and get health care reform  and a frozen low top marginal tax rate all in one fell swoop.

I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably enough  along with the usual good diet.  However  he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T  which used to be a doctors prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemists counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T  or that Clearasil is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager  nothing serious.  His father was the same  so I dont figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbours son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment.  I want to help   but with appropriate treatment. My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort of teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers advice on this   We have tried a couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to make the condition worse  not better. Shall I bury the kid till hes 21      No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. Ididnt have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily itreally only gets miserable pimples when its dry. Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalpthing under control might help  that could be as simple as submerging underthe bathwater till its softened and washing it out . Taking a one a dayvitamin mineral might help. Ive heard iodine causes trouble and that it  is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might bewhere the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease on my face  not immediately removed will cause acne  even from eatingmeat .Keeping hair rinse  mousse  dip  and spray off the face will help. Warmwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores willhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic  loves water and itsoftens and washes off when it has a chance. Thats why hair goes limp withoilyness. Becoming convinced that the best thing to do witha whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Anyprying of black or whiteheads can cause infections  the red spots ofpimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there wontbe an infection afterwards.Tell him that its normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industrymakes its money off of selling people on the idea that they are anincredible defect to be hidden at any cost  even that of causing more pimples .

The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque  theNicene   Constantinopolitan did not.\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the NiceneCreed  it wasnt there to begin with   but they certainly did from theAthanasian Creed  which did have it from the beginning.\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference inways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity  the Eastemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Fatherthrough the Son  and the West using proceeding from the Father and theSon.  In fact  some  such as Tertullian  used both formulations  seebelow \\t Following  therefore  the form of these examples  I profess that I docall God and His Word    the Father and and His Son    two.  For theroot and the stem are two things  but conjoined  the fountain and theriver are two kinds  but indivisible  the sun and the ray are two forms but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another mustnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds  but it is not onthat account separated from it.  Where there is second  however  thereare two  and where ther is third  there are three.  The Spirit  then  isthird from God and the Son  just as the third from the root is the fruitof the stem  and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray. \\t Tertullian  Against Praxeas  8  5  about 213 AD and\\t I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Fatherthrough the Son \\t Tertullian  Against Praxeas  4  1  about 213 AD And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1  Question 36 Articles 2 and 3  there is no contradiction between the two methods ofgeneration  and in fact  the two methods of reckoning the processionemphasize what St. Augustine  among others taught  that the Holy Spiritproceeds from the Father and the Son  but He proceeds from the Father ina more preeminent way.\\t For whatever the Son has  He has from the Father  certainly He has itfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For theFather alone is not from another  for which reason He alone is calledunbegotten  not  indeed  in the Scriptures  but in the practice oftheologians  and of those who employ such terms as they are able in amatter so great.  The Son  however  is born of the Father  and the HolySpirit proceeds principally from the Father  and since the Father givesto the Son all that He has without any interval of time  the Holy Spiritproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son ofthe Father and of the Son if  which is abhorent to everyone of soundmind  they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each however  but proceeds from each and both. \\t St. Augustine of Hippo  The Trinity  15  26  47  400 to 416 AD So  in a sense  all of the formulations are correct  to the West atleast   because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son  butin proceeding from the Son  the orgin of that procession is theprocession from the Father  so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from theFather through the Son  but as all that the Son has is from the Father the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father  without anymention of the Son being necessary.\\tIn any case  I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of PopeSt. Leo I  St. Fulgence of Ruspe  St. Cyril of Alexandria  Pope St.Damsus I  St. Augustine of Hippo  St. Epiphanius of Salamis  St. Ambroseof Milan  St. Hilary of Poitiers  Tertullian  and others among theFathers  who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholicposition  which I enunciated above.\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden  Iwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spokeof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone  to produce write  or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined bythe Fathers of Nicea.   That Creed is a different Creed than that ofConstantinople  which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not ofcourse in that they were condemning the adoption of theConstantinopolitan Creed  which is but an enlargement upon the Creed ofNicea  but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by theChurch  which among other things denied the procession of the HolySpirit form the Son.  Thus  the additions of the ConstantinopolitanCreed were not thought to be in violation of this  and as the CouncilChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the HolySpirit from the Son  which Nestorius denied  they could hardly have beenagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed  for they themselvesapproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanationsof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the workdone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical  it followsthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputedby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Ariansin Spain  because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church untilmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque wasnot disputed  I provide more quotes below.\\t Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed toGod  and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son  it is abundantlyclear that He is of the divine essence  in it in essence and proceedingfrom it. \\t St. Cyril of Alexandria  The Treasury of the Holy and ConsubstantialTrinity  Thesis 34   423 425 AD \\t The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only  or of the Son only  but heis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written   If anyoneloves the world  the Spirit of the Father is not in him  and again itis written   If anyone  however  does not have the Spirit of Christ  heis none of His.  When the Father and the Son are named in this way  theHoly Spirit is understood  of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel that the Holy Spirit  proceeds from the Father  and that  He shallreceive of mine and shall announce it to you. \\t Pope St. Damasus I  The Decree of Damasus  1  382 AD \\t The only begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor theappelation of Father  but is called Holy Spirit  and is not foreign tothe Father.  For the Only begotten Himself calls Him   the Spirit of theFather  and says of Him the  He proceeds from the Father  and  willreceive of mine  so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to theSon  but is of their same substance  of the same Godhead  He is Spiritdivine  ... of God  and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God  Spirit ofthe Father  and Spirit of the Son  not by some kind of synthesis  likesoul and body in us  but in the midst of Father and Son of the Fatherand of the Son  a third by appelation....\\t The Father always existed and the Son always existed  and the Spiritbreathes from the Father and the Son  and neither is the Son created noris the Spirit created. \\t St. Epiphanius of Salamis  which is on Cyprus   The Man Well Anchored 8 and 75  374 AD \\t Concerning the Holy Spirit  I ought not to remain silent  nor yet isit necessary to speak.  Still  on account of those who do not know Him it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary tospeak of Him who must be acknowledged  who is from the Father and theSon  His Sources. \\t St. Hilary of Poitiers  The Trintiy  2  29  356 to 359 AD \\tThus  as I have pointed out before  Gaul  Spain  Italy  Africa  Egypt Palastine  and the lands of the Greeks  all of Christnedom at that time all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrineexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Churchthat they come up with some of the Fathers  besides St. John of Damascuswho all will admit denied the filioque  to support their views.  It isnot enough to bring up the  proceeds from the Father  line of the Creedor the Gospel of John  for that says what we believe also.  But it doesnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son  only that He doesproceed from the Father.Andy Byler',\n",

Hughes  writes   berry durian.citr.uq.oz.au  Andrew Berry  writes    Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about   100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to  redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups  pertaining to Motif has been high.       I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial   and non commercial software  ie. you will only get free software using   Athena or OpenLook widget sets  and only get commercial software using   the Motif widget sets .        I cant see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif  by default and you can buy it for under  100 for the  free  UNIX  platforms  I cant see this causing major problems.  Let me add another of my concerns  Yes  I can buy a port of Motif for  cheap  but I cannot get the source for  cheap   hence I am limited to using whatever Xlibraries the Motif port was compiled against  at least with older versions ofMotif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X  but I have notseen it myself .  Currently  I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms  of whichonly three came with Motif. On those three  I am unable to use the X11R5libraries to build Motif clients  because I get link errors between thevendor supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this sameproblem when X11R6 becomes available.  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5  since I donot have Motif compiled under X11R5. True  I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of  free   doesnt it     Cheers     Tom McConnell    Tom McConnell                Internet  tmcconne sedona.intel.com Intel  Corp.

I have checked some  geometry books  Graphics Gems  and Farin  but am still at a loss   Please have mercy on me and provide the solution     Wouldnt this require a hyper sphere.  In 3 space  4 points over specifies a sphere as far as I can see.  Unless that is you can prove that a point exists in 3 space that is equi distant from the 4 points  and this may not necessarily happen.  Correct me if Im wrong  which I quite possibly am    steveSorry      Call the four points A  B  C and D. Any three of them must benon collinear  otherwise all three could not lie on the surfaceof a sphere  and all four must not be coplaner  otherwise eitherthey cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them .A  B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB  BCand CA  meet in a point  P  say  which is the centre of this circle.This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All pointson this normal are equidistant from A  B and C and its circle  infact it is a diameter of the desired sphere . Take the planecontaining this normal and D  if D lies on the normal anyplane containing the normal will do   this plane is at right anglesto the ABC one.Let E be the point  there are normally two of them  on the circumferenceof the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on thenormal such that EQ   DQ.

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.Today  x Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x Soviet Armenia.Today  x Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity.x Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands  to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.During the 78th Anniversary  we come once again reiterate theunity of the Muslim People  the timelessness of the Turkishand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the strugglefor that restitution   a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.Today  we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative Events  be they cultural  political or religious.Serdar Argic                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.

The net result of this is that you _cant_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears  or psychos  in the National Parks.  Instead  one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances of hiking in bear country  and take the appropriate precautions.  I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer to Nature  that they are a part of Nature and  as such  have to deal with nature on its own terms.  GuyHello \\tI understand this philosophy.  The bears are a nationaltreasure  the area is their sanctuary and people who enter itdo so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human bekilled by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear savvyvisitors.  The bears arent having a population explosion  humansare so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.I dont agree with this philosopy  but I understand it.\\tThe psychos are a bit different.  They are not a nationaltreasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to  allow provision for defense against them would also  allow  provisionfor defense against bears.  Again  I suppose it has been decidedthat it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho thanto take a chance on threatening the bears.\\tPersonally  I wouldnt go into an area where I would be managed  so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to thinkof it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself    Joan V  ',\n",

I am confident in my pediatrician and her communication with the people in Chapel Hill  but since this is a life long disorder and genetically transferred I would like keep current.  I do realize that since this is a relatively new disorder  first documented in 1974 in a fertility clinic in Scandanavia  and is therefore  controversial .I do not know a lot about this  except from seeing one patient with Kartageners syndrome   which is a form of immotile cilia syndromein which there is situs inversus  bronchiectasis  and chronicinfections.  Situs inversus  means that organs are on the wrongside of the body  and can be complete or partial. It is interestingmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in partby the  normal  rotation associated with ciliary motion  so that inabsence of this  laterality can be  random.  People with situsinversus are quite popular at medical schools  because of theirrarity  and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when theycant find the patients heart sounds  because theyre on the wrongside . According to Harrisons  immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomalrecessive  which should imply that on average one child in fourin a family would be affected. But there may be much more currentinformation on this  and as usual in medicine  we may be talkingabout more than one conditiion.

But anullments  are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope    not sure if the Pope delegates this function .  Maybe Im a little tired but I cant seem to follow the logic here. If whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest RC only apparently  is required. In fact if I read the next verse correctly  Matthew 18 19  I understand thatfor a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touchingone thing and it shall be done.Todd                                                                                  Mark Ashley                         DISCLAIMER  My opinions. Not Harris  marka gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com         The Lost Los Angelino                Unfortunately I havent been able to find any completely precisestatements about what is needed.   As usual  the current edition ofthe Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.   I do know that thepriest is viewed as a witness  and thus in some sense would not berequired.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoidany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  Thecommunity provides support to marriage  and in cases of problems areinvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much oftheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a publiccommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regularmarriage.  Where Im not clear is exactly where the boundaries are inexceptional cases   valid but irregular  .  Ne Temere  1907  says thatno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest  accordingto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church   and they imply that the newcanon law retains this  but Id rather see a more recent andauthoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is requiredfor Catholics  the Catholic church does recognize marriage betweenbaptized non Catholics as valid without a priest.    clh ',\n",

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at65 MHz  which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also beable to tell the difference between a blank screen  about 300 mv and a dim screen  say  around 310 mv .  Oh yes  it also needs to becheap.  My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators  eachcompariator had the   input going to one of the guns  the   inputwent to a reference created by a voltage divider a potentiometer .The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. Ineeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire thecompariators  so I could have a whole screen full of text  but mycircuit would not detect it.   The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference thenthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  Infact the difference between completely black and completely white isonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify thevideo signals to make this work.  There are faster compariators  but they are expensive  and require split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariatorwith three 1.89 compariators  and create a whole new power supplycircuit.  At this point  I think what I need is some sort of transistorcircuit.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO  andcommercial space.  This is how it went...After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator  D  PattyMurray  Washington State.  I started asking for an hour  and when I heardthe gasp on the end of the phone  I quickly backed off to 1 2 an hour.Later in that conversation  I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is  we were called back by an aide who scheduled a meeting with us  in order to determine that we were notbozos  and to familiarize himself with the material  and to screen it  to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.Well  I got allocated 1 2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide  and we ended up talkingto him for 45 minutes  with us ending the meeting  and him still listening.We covered a lot of ground  and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was anotherwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic thatwe brought up.But  with Murray being new  we wanted to entrench ourselves as non corporatealigned  I.E. not speaking for boeing  local citizens interentested in space.So  we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here  so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access  and we hit the environmental stand on that.We hit the tourism angle  and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourismpaper  with side notes being that everyone who goes into space  and sees theatmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist  esp. after SEEING the smogover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification  which is more pronounced in space  and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of  and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space  but as they get older and find out thatthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there  they go on to otherfields  with low cost to orbit  the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches  gps navigation  personalcommunicators  tellecommunications  new services  etc...  Jobs providedin those sectors.Jobs provided building the thing  balance of trade improvement  etc..We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts areproceeding in this area  and that we want to make sure that theresults from these efforts are not lost  much like condor  or majellan  and most importantly  we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act  and the guy filed it separately  he was VERY interested in it.He asked some questions about it  and seemed like he wanted to jump on it and contact some of the people involved with it  so something may actuallyhappen immediatly there.The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that weknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town  and that theycould feel free to call us any time with questions  and if we didnt knowthe answers  that we would see to it that they questions got to people whoreally did know the answers.Then finally  we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  Hesaid that we would get on the list  and he also said that knowing her  thiswould be something that she would be very interested in  although theydo have a time problem getting her scheduled  since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\\t\\t\\tJohn.',\n",

OtherwiseI agree  there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief.The Quran makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Publicor private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is notpunishable  there are some jurists who have gone against thistrend and insisted that apostasy is punishable  even by death    buthistorically they are the exception.Cursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of  Shatim .

He noted  ...certain practices have been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality  and sometimes of hilarity  has trivialized the liturgy.   I note that at my parents parish on Easter  helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory  apparently to aid in understanding the word  risen .  This was not a kiddie mass  either  but the well attended 11 00 Mass.I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as awhole offers generally moderate  perhaps because its moderated  conversationon topics that often lead people to extreme behavior  including myself .Sometimes people do go over the top  but the remarkable thing is how that isthe exception  I think.

I asked myself  how big could the escrow databaseget  How hard might it be to steal the whole thing  particularly wereI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrowhouses   We can pretend that such will not happen  but thats naive. Well  lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes ofserial number    in fact  I believe the serial number is smaller  butthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250 10 6 as thepopulation  and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes foreach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single veryvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time  but whocares    I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in mypocket on two 8mm tapes.Admittely  they will think of safeguards. They wont put the wholedatabase on one disk  prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocksin the way. This changes nothing    they keys will be needed every dayby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types  so conveniencewill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. Atsome point  with or without collusion by the agencies  those exabytetapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight willdoubtless claim this cant happen    but we know that  cant  is aprayer  not a word that in this instance connotes realism.With two exabyte tapes in your pocket  you would hold the keys forevery persons conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah  youneed the  master key  two    but thats just ten bytes of informationthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.Come to think of it  even if the NSA getting a copy of the databaseisnt a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversialpolitical views  consider foreign intelligence services. You know  theones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of theevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do havea big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrialsecrets  so he isnt being completely irrational here  although whyour companies couldnt use cryptosystems without back doors is leftunexplained by those that point out this threat.  Presumably  foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSAand other agencies. We have proof by example of this  its happenedmany times. Presumably  someday they will get their hands on somefraction of the keys. You cant avoid that sort of thing.Dont pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands onthe escrow databases.We crypto types are all taught something very important at thebeginning of intro to cryptography    security must depend on theeasily changed key that you pick to run your system  and not on asecret. The escrow databases arent the sorts of secrets that ourteachers told us about  but they are the sort of big secrets theywould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 millionClipper chips.I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing thisdoesnt realize all this already. They are too smart. There are toomany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspectthat they know precisely what they are doing    and that what they aredoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continueto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspectthat they realize that they cant put things off forever  but they cantry to delay things as long as possible.Who knows.

For Streptomycin  usually given intra  muscularly  use a thin needle  23 24 guage  and select a spot on  the upper  outer thigh  no major nerves or blood vessels there .   Clean the area with antiseptic before injection  and after. Make  sure to inject deeply  a different kind of pain is felt when the  needle enters the muscle   contrasted to the prick when it   pierces the skin .    PS  Try to go to a doctor. Self treatment and self injection should  be avoided as far as possible.   The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little fat.  I inject on my legs and gut  and prefer the gut.  I can stickit in at a 90 degree angle  and barely feel it.  Im not fat  justhave a little gut.  My legs however  are muscular  and I have to pinchto get anything  and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle and itstill hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  muscular injections however  so if its a daily thing it would bebest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Althoughsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot  to prevent irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep  wait for it to dry somewhat  or you may get the alcohol in thepuncture  and of course  that doesnt feel good.  A way to preventirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way todo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot and spacing the sites out accuartely  about 1 1 2   apart. This is from experience  so I hope itll help you.

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion onwhom he will have compassion  Ex 33 19 .  However  if he enjoyedpunishing people and sending them to hell  then why would he send Jesusto  seek and save that which was lost   Luke 19 10    To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed  remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their judgement is soon to come.  Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  Stay away from human theories  and only take into account references in the bible. You asked for it.2 Peter 2 4 ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.Matthew 25 31 46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous inGods eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.2 Thessalonians 1 6 10 states that those who cause trouble for thedisciples  will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut outfrom the presence of the Lord .2 Thessalonians 2 9 12 talks about those who refuse to love the truthbeing condemned.Revelation 21 6 8 talks about the difference between those who overcomesand those who do not.  Those who do not  listed in verse 8  will be inthe  fiery lake of burning sulfur .Revelation 14 9 12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast will be tormented with burning sulfur  and there being  no rest day ornight  for them because of it.Psalm 9 17    The wicked return to the grave  all the nations thatforget God. I think those should be sufficient to prove the point. DariusJoe Fisher In the following Im mostly playing  devils advocate .  Im notadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand thatits possible to see these passages in different ways.  Its possibleto see eternal destruction as just that    destruction.  Rev oftenuses the term  second death .  The most obvious understanding of thatwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaksboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses termsthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convinceyou of one view or the other  but to help people understand thattheres a wide enough variety of images that its possible tounderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented  the primarypoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire whatever the details.   To make things more interesting  Luke 20 35implies that the damned dont get resurrected at all.  Presumablythey just stay dead.    yes Im aware that its possible to understand this passage in a non literal way. 2 Peter 2 4 ff is talking about angels  and talks about holding themin hell until the final judgement.  This isnt eternal punishement.Matthew 25 31 46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fireprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire iseternal doesnt mean that people will last in its flames forever.Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having beenprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about theeternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophetwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people beingthrown into it  20 13 14   it is referred to as  the second death .This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possiblethat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such asthe devil  and humans 2 Thessalonians 1 6 10 similarly  what is  everlasting destruction  This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly beunderstood either way  but I think its at least possible to thinkthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destructionthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs ineternity.2 Thessalonians 2 8 again talks about destruction.Revelation 21 6 8  see comment aboveRevelation 14 9 12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there it doesnt explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It saysthat the smoke  and presumably the fire  is eternal  and that there is no respite from it.  But it doesnt say that the peopleare tormented forever.Psalm 9 17   I dont see that it says anything relevant to this issue.  clh ',\n",

Actually  the SC300  the  coupe  and the GS300  the funky looking new sedan  share the same 3.0  liter inline six  and the ES300  popular small sedan  uses 3.0 V6 shared  with the Camry.

A couple of points on this thread.1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is   not dependent on  sophisticated tools    CASE tools  .  However  tools   cannot fix a bad process.  Also  tool support for HAL S  the Shuttle   Language  is somewhat limited.3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated  Level 5  by a NASA team.

Playoffs           Stauber disturbed by third man themeby Rick Sadowski  Daily NewsBarry Melroses decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in thecrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well withthe rookie goaltender. I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year  the mostfun time of the year  and Im not    Stauber said with some emotion Monday.   Ithink I have worked hard enough for that. Stauber said he accepts Melroses choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goaliein their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays6 3 opening victory.But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind RickKnickle.  Stauber had a 4 1 2 record and 2.98 goals against average down thestretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.Knickle   He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average  twice was yanked from games  once for stomach cramps  and hasnt played since March 29.Yet  when the series resumes Wednesday  Knickle will serve as Hrudeys backupagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on OlympicSaddledome popcorn. If Im supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...Idropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2    Stauber wondered.   Not that Id behappy with No. 2  but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in theplayoffs. Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance  but Melrose apparently is notconvinced the 25 year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.While insisting he is the Kings  goalie of the future   Melrose said Stauberflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were according to Melrose  a 7 2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26  An 8 3 loss to the NewYork Rangers on Jan. 23  a 6 6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11  an 8 6 loss to Vancouver on Thursday. Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie  he couldhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey  and he didnt do it   Melrose said.   Anelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of agreat goalie is that he isnt satisfied to be a backup.  Im not blaming Robb for the losses  but if youre going to be No. 1  youvegot to be able to walk your talk.  Youve got to be able to play when everythingis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability  but maybe I expectmore from him than he does. Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9 0 1  struggled when theteam hit a mid season slump  didnt play for a month after Knickle was signedoff the San Diego Gulls roster  then came on at the end. I expect more from myself than anybody  including Barry Melrose   said Stauber a three year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989  only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries. What Ive been through the last four years   two knee operations  a herniateddisk in my back  shoulder surgery   what more can I go through   I obviously doexpect a lot from myself  otherwise I wouldnt be here.  Anybody who would disagree with that doesnt know me.  Im not saying Barry doesnt know me  but dont say Ive been without expectations.  If anything  Ima perfectionist. Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned.  But even though I didnt play well  I get knocked down from maybe on to three  Its a bit of a jump   he said.   Youre almost No. 1  or if you play a good game youre No. 1 and if you dont youre No. 3   Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75   Can you explain that   Thats what barry wanted me to explain to him  why I didnt come through when he counted on me.  I dont know. What I do know is  its a sport.  Ill be there. Melroses  goalie of the future  statement doesnt mean much to Stauber.  Beforeyou know it  Ill be 30 and there will be no future   he said.       Game 1 of the Kings   Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC Channel 7 here in LA.

       "  476: 'Organization  Applied Presuppositionalism  Ltd.Lines  39REXLEX fnal.fnal.gov writes  We can jillustrate this by pointing to the way God administers His judgment.  In the OT  sins were not forgiven  but rather covered up.  In the age of the Church not only are sins forgiven  taken away   but the power of SIN is put to death.  ...My  this distinction seems quite arbitrary.  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven  whose sin is covered.   Ps. 32 1 .and quoted by the apostle Paul   Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man  unto whom God  imputeth righteousness without works   Saying  Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven  and whose sins  are covered.  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.   Rom. 4 6 8 The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering areparallel equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensationaldistinction is unwarranted.         During the millenium  we read that sins are dealt with immediately under the present  ie that Christ is present on earth  rulership of Christ.Im sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.

I Peter 3 7  One interpretation Ive heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing ones wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer. Jayne Kulikauskas  jayne mmalt.guild.orgI would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard toblocking prayer.  I have trouble thinking that God would allowanything to block our access to him in prayer  especially if we havesinned and are praying for forgivenenss.    I can see  however  how our prayer life might be hindered by oursin  if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what hashappened  we may not be thinking about prayer  thus our prayers arehindered by our own actions.    But I dont think anything can block the transmission  orreception of prayer to God.Shalom                                       Len Howard',\n",

Thats also untrue  but at least were wandering a little closer  toward reality.  That the Articles of Confederation fell apart is enough  proof it was there for just a tad bit more.Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is thereforedifficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. Theycertainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but thiswas not necessarily their true position.   And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty   wide powers. Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock   set in.           I wasnt aware the House of Lords had  wide powers.   I was under the  impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons  and  certainly didnt have almost equal their powers.   The Senate is restricted  only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue. The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question.The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914and David Llloyd Georges budget. Even despite this the House of Lords hasconsiderable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.          My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely  no reason to believe the Senate wasnt intended to make use of their   law making powers.  In fact  grid lock appears to have been designed  into the system  with the Senate being a more deliberative body to act  as a check on the more often elected House.The system is meant to be slow to react  the problem is that it ended upa bit too slow.         On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be  some sort of rubber stamp for the House   Youll note that while the  Presidents veto may be over ridden  the House cant do anything about  a  veto  by the Senate.The President veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused itin a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intentof being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted topreventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body  it is meant asa check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built intothe constitution in favour of the status quo  60  of the representativesof the states is not a reasonable restriction. ',\n",

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction tologic  in the hope of improving the general level of debate.Logic is the science of reasoning  proof  thinking  or inference  ConciseOED .  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whetherit is correct or not  valid or invalid .  Of course  one does not need tostudy logic in order to reason correctly  nevertheless  a little basicknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing anargument.Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universallyapplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merelyexplains how to use logic  given that you have already decided that logic isthe right tool for the job.Propositions  or statements  are the building blocks of a logical argument. Aproposition is a statement which is either true or false  for example   It israining  or  Today is Tuesday .  Propositions may be either asserted  said tobe true  or denied  said to be false .  Note that this is a technical meaningof  deny   not the everyday meaning.The proposition is the meaning of the statement  not the particulararrangement of words used to express it.  So  God exists  and  There exists aGod  both express the same proposition.An argument is  to quote the Monty Python sketch   a connected series ofstatements to establish a definite proposition .  An argument consists ofthree stages.First of all  the propositions which are necessary for the argument tocontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  Theyare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. Premises  or assertions  are often indicated by phrases such as  because   since    obviously  and so on.   The phrase  obviously  is often viewed withsuspicion  as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspiciouspremises.  If something doesnt seem obvious to you  dont be afraid toquestion it.  You can always say  Oh  yes  youre right  it is obvious  whenyouve heard the explanation. Next  the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process knownas inference.  In inference  one proposition is arrived at on the basis ofone or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms ofvalid inference.The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in furtherinference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as  implies that  or therefore .Finally  we arrive at the conclusion of the argument    the proposition whichis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are oftenindicated by phrases such as  therefore    it follows that    we conclude and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.For example Every event has a cause  premise The universe has a beginning  premise All beginnings involve an event  premise This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event  inference Therefore the universe has a cause  inference and conclusion Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in anotherargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion withrespect to a particular argument  the terms do not make sense in isolation.Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above  for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid  if sometimes a little confusing.Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises orconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without everproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Somestatements look like arguments  but are not.  For example  If the Bible is accurate  Jesus must either have been insane  an evil liar  or the Son of God. This is not an argument  it is a conditional statement.  It does not assertthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion.   It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws  but wellcome to those later. Another example  God created you  therefore do your duty to God. The phrase  do your duty to God  is not a proposition  since it is neithertrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion  and the sentence is not anargument.Finally  causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form  A becauseB .  If were interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence  thestatement is an argument.  If were trying to establish the truth of B  thenit is not an argument  it is an explanation.For example  There must be something wrong with the engine of my car  because it will not start.     This is an argument. My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.     This is an explanation.There are two traditional types of argument  deductive and inductive.  Adeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions   that is  an argument where if the premises are true  the conclusion mustalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A validargument is defined as one where if the premises are true  then theconclusion is true.An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for thetruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however  we can talk about whether they are better or worse than otherarguments  and about how probable their premises are.There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductivenor inductive.  However  we will concentrate for the moment on deductivearguments  as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid doesnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication  which we must now consider morecarefully.Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However  anargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. For example    All insects have wings  premise    Woodlice are insects  premise    Therefore woodlice have wings  conclusion Here  the conclusion is not true because the arguments premises are false. If the arguments premises were true  however  the conclusion would be true. The argument is thus entirely valid.More subtly  we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in    All fish live in the sea  premise    Dolphins are fish  premise    Therefore dolphins live in the sea  conclusion However  the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through validinference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a  truth table  forimplication.The symbol      denotes implication   A  is the premise   B  the conclusion.  T  and  F  represent true and false respectively.Premise Conclusion Inference   A        B        A  B                               F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference   F        T         T      valid  the conclusion can be true or false.   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                             false  the inference must be invalid.   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid                              the conclusion must be true.A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confusevalid arguments with sound arguments.To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would requirelengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probablymore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructingan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.In everyday English the term  fallacy  is used to refer to mistaken beliefsas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fairenough  but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form oftechnically incorrect argument  especially if the argument appears valid orconvincing.So for the purposes of this discussion  we define a fallacy as a logicalargument which appears to be correct  but which can be seen to be incorrectwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid beingmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to beexhaustive.ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM  APPEAL TO FORCE The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or thethreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  Itis often used by politicians  and can be summarized as  might makes right . The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.For example  ... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those whorefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell. ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEMArgumentum ad hominem is literally  argument directed at the man .The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when  instead of tryingto disprove the truth of an assertion  the arguer attacks the person orpeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of anassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.For example  Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers. Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing  for example  that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way ofreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness  and notargumentum ad hominem  however  it does not demonstrate that the witnessstestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of theArgumentum ad Ignorantiam  see elsewhere in this list .The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a personargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because ofthe opponents particular circumstances.For example  It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argueotherwise when youre quite happy to wear leather shoes  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency  used as an excuse for dismissingthe opponents argument.This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For example  Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. Youre white. This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem  when one alleges that onesadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests  isalso known as  poisoning the well .ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUMArgumentum ad ignorantium means  argument from ignorance .  This fallacyoccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because ithas not been proved false.  Or  equivalently  when it is argued thatsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.   Note that thisis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been provedtrue  a basic scientific principle. Examples  Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.  Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody hasshown any proof that they are real. Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law  where one isgenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.Also  in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would producecertain evidence of its having occurred  the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example  A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of waterto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore nosuch flood occurred. In science  we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something hasnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however.ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAMThis is the Appeal to Pity  also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted.  For example  I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please dont find meguilty  Im suffering enough through being an orphan. ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUMThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery  or Appealing to the People.  Tocommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion byappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is oftencharacterized by emotive language.  For example  Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.  The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you tryingto tell them that they are all mistaken fools  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAMThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists ofasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition  the morelikely it is that that proposition is correct.ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAMThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and winsupport for an assertion.  For example  Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God. This line of argument is not always completely bogus  for example  referenceto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to adiscussion of that subject.  For example  we can distinguish quite clearlybetween  Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer Hawking is a physicist  and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on blackhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist  so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENTThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to aparticular case whose  accidental  circumstances mean that the rule isinapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to thespecific.  For example  Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian  so you mustdislike atheists. This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decideevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.CONVERSE ACCIDENT   HASTY GENERALIZATIONThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when oneforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are notrepresentative of all possible cases.For example  Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians areinsincere. SWEEPING GENERALIZATION   DICTO SIMPLICITERA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to aparticular situation in which the features of that particular situationrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of ahasty generalization.NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA   POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOCThese are known as False Cause fallacies.The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as thecause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For example  I took an aspirin and prayed to God  and my headache disappeared.  So Godcured me of the headache. The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed tobe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For example  The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoidatheism for the same reasons. CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOCThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts thatbecause two events occur together  they must be causally related  and leavesno room for other factors that may be the cause s  of the events.PETITIO PRINCIPIIThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as theconclusion reached.CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDOThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which onewishes to reach.  Often  the proposition will be rephrased so that thefallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example  Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence anygovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret  and will be opento blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold governmentoffice. Note that the argument is entirely circular  the premise is the same as the conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reasonfor the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employees. Another example is the classic  We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that theBible is true because it is the word of God. COMPLEX QUESTION   FALLACY OF INTERROGATIONThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded question  Have you stopped beating your wife  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has noteven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like  Where did you hide the money you stole  Similarly  politicians often ask loaded questions such as  How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue  or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization  IGNORATIO ELENCHIThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to dowith that conclusion.For example  a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that theteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at lengththat Christianity is of great help to many people  no matter how well heargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.Sadly  such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouseemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a morefavourable light.EQUIVOCATIONEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more differentmeanings in the same argument.  For example  What could be more affordable than free software   But to make sure that itremains free  that users can do what they like with it  we must place alicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable. AMPHIBOLYAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous becauseof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.ACCENTAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement areemphasized.  For example  consider  We should not speak ILL of our friends and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS FALLACIES OF COMPOSITIONOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the partsof something must apply to the whole.  For example  The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components  and is therefore very lightweight. The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a numberof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example  A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore carsare less environmentally damaging than buses. FALLACY OF DIVISIONThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Likeits opposite  it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that aproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example  You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich. The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared byeach item.  For example  Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree. THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENTThis argument states that should one event occur  so will other harmfulevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by thefirst event.For example  If we legalize marijuana  then we would have to legalize crack and heroinand well have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannotlegalize marijuana.  A IS BASED ON B  FALLACIES    IS A TYPE OF  FALLACIESThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some waysimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.Examples  Isnt history based upon faith   If so  then isnt the Bible also a form ofhistory   Islam is based on faith  Christianity is based on faith  so isnt Islam aform of Christianity   Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry  dogs are a form ofanimal based on carbon chemistry  so arent dogs a form of cat  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENTThis fallacy is an argument of the form  A implies B  B is true  therefore Ais true .  To understand why it is a fallacy  examine the truth table forimplication given earlier.DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENTThis fallacy is an argument of the form  A implies B  A is false  therefore Bis false .  Again  the truth table for implication makes it clear why this isa fallacy.Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa  the latter hasthe form  A implies B  A is false  therefore B is false   where A does NOT infact imply B at all.  Here  the problem is not that the implication isinvalid  rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduceanything about B.CONVERTING A CONDITIONALThis fallacy is an argument of the form  If A then B  therefore if B then A .ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAMThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simplybecause it is old  or because  thats the way its always been. ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAMThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam  it is the fallacy ofasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newerthan something else.ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAMThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness  that thosewith more money are more likely to be right.ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUMThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder ormore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of theargumentum ad crumenam.ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAMThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true themore often it is heard.  An  argumentum ad nauseum  is one that employsconstant repetition in asserting something.BIFURCATIONAlso referred to as the  black and white  fallacy  bifurcation occurs whenone presents a situation as having only two alternatives  where in fact otheralternatives exist or can exist.PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM   MANY QUESTIONSThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complexquestion.NON SEQUITURA non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premiseswhich are not logically connected with it.RED HERRINGThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issuebeing discussed  so that everyones attention is diverted away from thepoints being made  towards a different conclusion.REIFICATION   HYPOSTATIZATIONReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOFThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion orproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof  a special case of argumentum adignorantium  is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person whodenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy isthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.STRAW MANThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that itcan be attacked more easily  then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is afallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have beenmade.THE EXTENDED ANALOGYThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested generalrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations  in an argument about a general rule  constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other.This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation  I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.  Such a position is odious  it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King.  Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation   How dare you  TU QUOQUEThis is the famous  you too  fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued tobe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance  Youre just being randomly abusive.  So   Youve been abusive too. ÿ',\n",

You  play  the  same  team  in a consecutive string of games.  Is this  what you mean by pressure   Have you even thought about what  you  mean  by pressure  or are your thoughts  like most of the rest of  this drivel  simply half baked  This was  1993Mar21.223936.6192 ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca   for anybody who would like to check. He went on  in another article  to say  paraphrased    Playoff hockey  is just an expression used by announcers to convince  simple minded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better  product than a regular season game.  NOW   however  in article  1993Apr12.013939.23016 ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca    Roger Maynard  writes   With a 4 2 win over a tough Whaler squad the Leafs showed all doubters  what playoff hockey is all about.                                     So  Roger  what exactly  is  playoff hockey all about   Or is it a convenient phrase to use in certain circumstances only  You see  when you spout off with flame bait too many times  sooner or later it catches up with you....Nice try Deepak  but  tough Whaler squad  should have clued you in to thefact that my Leaf woofing was tongue in cheek.If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety thenit is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive timesin 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is  some things willbe carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that isonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest  who have been playing withinjuries  who miss their families  or who  like Grant Fuhr  would reallyrather be playing golf  dont really give a damn.  Of course I cant say thisfor sure  but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and Idont think that hockey players are above having what I consider typicallyhuman attitudes.  With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff take  as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikelyto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you aregoing to come back with  winning spirit  and all of that crap but theseplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose  which is  to makea decent living. Of course  the coach is a professional as well  and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players.  So  if the coach does hisjob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.The second season  is after all  merely an exhibition.  The true Championsof the league are the division winners  the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merelyaccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and  hot .  The emphasis on the playoffs  with their  sudden death  appeal has been promotedby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburghloses the playoffs  we all know that they were really the best team in theleague over the year.  They proved it.cordially  as always rm   Roger Maynard maynard ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca ',\n",

       "  503: 'Reply To  sera zuma.UUCP  Serdar Argic Distribution  worldLines  201In article  C60B63.G2M panix.com  mpoly panix.com  Michael S. Polymenakos  writes   Well  ZUMABOT claims just the opposite  That Greeks are not allowing Turks to exit the country. Now  explain this  The number of Turks in Thrace has steadily risen from 50 000 in 23 to 80 000  while the Greeks ofDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed. I have been observing that Poly has been practicing Goebels rule quite loyally. Polys audience is mostly made of Greeks who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However  in todays informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For instance  those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what really happened. There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital  The Greek Girls Lycee Alumni Association  the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society  the Greek Medical Foundation  the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation  the Yovakimion Greek Girls Lycee Foundation  and the Fener Greek Mens Lycee Foundation.  As for Greece  the longstanding use of the adjective Turkish in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers Association  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turksin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to removethe word Turkish on their buildings and on their officialpapers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict  November 4  1987  of the Greek High Court.In the city of Komotini  a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkishparentage  was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonmentwith no right to appeal  just for saying outloud that he wasof Turkish descent. This duly elected ethnic Turkish officialwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle  used by the Greek governments  to cover up their inferiority complex they display  vis a vis  the people of Turkiye. The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term Turks  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to Muslims. The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The Pomaks are also a Muslim people  whom all the three nations  Bulgarians  Turks  and Greeks  consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements  Poor Poly.It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkishminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition in 1980 the democratic Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091 virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar andother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self supportingreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus  irrespectiveof the will of the Turkish minority  as state official. Althoughthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters inGreece  the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electingits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction  which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage  is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the so called Greek Constitution  which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece  on the other hand  is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region.And you pondered. Sidiropoulos  the president of the Macedonian Human Rights Committee  became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation  Sidiropoulos has been sent to internal exile on the island of Kefalonia  hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. His employer  the Florina City Council  asked him to depart in 24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice and remains without a job. Helsinki Watch  a well known Human Rights group  had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990  their findings were published in a report titled  Destroying Ethnic Identity  Turks of Greece.The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction  which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage  is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlikwere attacked  and tombstones were broken. The cemetery inKarotas was razed by bulldozers.Shall I go on  Why not  The people of Turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turksin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile  Greek and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern Cyprus  a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.An acceptable method may certainly be found when thereis a will. But we know of various kinds of violentbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burningof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.Now wait  there is more.  Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna  May to July 1919   Inedited  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers  Published by  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne  Lausanne   Imprimerie Petter  Giesser   Held  Caroline  5  1919 .  pages 82 83    1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus   and the 90 Turkish travellers  men and women who were in it ordered   to descend. And there in the open street  under the eyes of their   husbands  fathers and brothers  the women without distinction of age   were violated  and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi  a native of Tripoli  and a   captain whose name is not known  and to whom the Hellenic authorities   had given safe conduct  were killed with specially atrocious tortures.   2. Before the battle  the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers  she was even stript   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the   following manner  Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt   end of a gun.   4. During the firing of the town  eleven children  six little girls   and five boys  fleeing from the flames  were stopped by Greek soldiers   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter  and thrown into a burning Jewish house   near bridge  where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.   5. The clock maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then   killed in the court of the Greek Church  but Ahmed Effendi has been   no more heard of.   6. At the market  during the fire  two unknown people were wounded   by bayonets  then bound together  thrown into the fire and burnt alive.   The Greeks killed also many Jews.

The Hirgun  and other branch  off militant groups  did fight the British do get them out ofPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form ofterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by theArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent Britishsoldiers  but not only thta also killed many Jews who were infavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition  theymassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948  contributingto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared theirvery lives.\\tI mention this not because Im anti semitic  Im partJewish  but because this self righteousness on the part of theIsraelites pisses me off so.

If Jews had the same dream  I would not feel threatened a bit.There certainly are muslims who  do not  believe that their dream of a global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are  however  others  and  they are often far more visible vocal than the former  who  do  accept the establishment of global Islam through force. I  would  not  feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing  Islamicization  through peaceful means  nor by Jews advocating the sameapproach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their sidespower are certainly a threat.To Palestinians  Israel is doing just that  maintaining its dominanceof those  outside  its own  group .

I want also a honest answer from Zionists for the following questions I am not a zionist  but do feel that  both  Jewish and Palestiniannationalist desires need  at this juncture  to be accepted in some way.  1 why do jews who dont even believe in God  as is the case with many of the founders of secular zionism  have a right in Palestine more than the inhabitants of Palestine  just because God gave you the land  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   For the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteousfor Islam to be spread by force upon those who DO NOT WANT THAT.  2 Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel  I refer to the  most  you also refer to  Because they are scared  and feel very threatened  as well feeling that this area  is  to some degree part of their belief religion heritage identity etc.I too strongly object to those that justify Israeli  rule  of those who DO NOT WANT THAT.

NASA would provide contractual launch services. However  since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates  WN 26 Mar 93  the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism  but Mike Lawson  CEO of Space Marketing  told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment  The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained  advertising is just to help defray costs.How could this possibly be  environmental vandalism  when there is no environment  to vandalize up there Since the advertising  is just to help defray costs   its certainly nosurprise that  the taxpayers would bear most of the expense .  Soundslike a good idea to me  since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of theexpense if they didnt do the advertising. What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky Great idea  they should have done it long ago. What about light pollution in observations   I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day  leave alone at night .I cant believe that a mile long billboard would have any significanteffect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day but nobody complains about that.  Besides  its in LEO  so it would onlybe visible during twilight when the sky is already bright  and even ifit would have some miniscule impact  it would be only for a short timeas it goes zipping across the sky.

What phony names  My name is clearly visible in the headers  and Ising the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that then you will have to get over it. Ive used this account name for over10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7generally recognize  Hades  as my account name. I have no intention ofchanging the way I post. I installed a couple of 16MB SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed by the general complexity of the operation compared to  for example  the wonderfully designed LC III. It irritates me when Apple refuses to tell how to do it in the Users Manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble the devise in question  its the same for adding memory to LaserWriter Pros .    It isnt Apples responsibility to tell its customers how to foolaround with its hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid todo. I personally like the design of the Q800  and applaud Apple forcoming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all ofthose drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900 950 design  exceptfor those people who need Drive Arrays. I do  however  agree with youabout the LW Pro design. The operation isnt very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were offered but Apple leaves you working blind.    Again  itss not Apples place to make it easy for non certifiedservice people to fool around with Apple hardware  even if they did buyit. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac  just dontget upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is nolonger valid. After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs came into contact with the plastic case frame. Mine actually contacted the framework with quite a lot of pressure    enough so that the assembly of the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required some force. I could have filed a little excess material off the top of the SIMM boards but chose to let it stand as is. I have not had problems with RAM yet so I will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic.    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MBSIMMs into an LC  back before low profile 4MB SIMMs were readilyavailable. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case andmake it a bit difficult to close the LC  but it did close and work justfine. One of the nice things about Logic Boards is that they aregenerally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure. Hades',\n",

       "  514: 'Organization  Stratus Computer  Inc.Lines  263Distribution  usaNNTP Posting Host  rocket.sw.stratus.com This is a co authored report from two of us who were there. Gun Owners Action League  our state rifle association  started the daywith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9 30.It was looking sparse  about 40 people  until the speaker began whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers fromwherever they had been lost  and filled out the area something proud.Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was toremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had beenchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state  while thepeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of election fraud  to hold their jobs.Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons andsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings  andtelling people where to find their own representatives  and in toomany cases  who they were .Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules anddiscuss a bill that hadnt made it onto the official list.  It seems adelegation of students from Simons Rock of Bard College  alma materof Wayne Lo  who shot up the place with an SKS late last year  wasbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms orammo to anyone who is not a state resident.The hearings were originally scheduled in the  large  GardnerAuditorium at 10 30  but that had been pre empted by the Governorshearings on the Framingham Eight  women in prison for killing abusivehusbands  and seeking release .  So we had until 1 30 to buttonholeour representatives  after which we would be squashed into aninadequate hearing room.One of my representatives staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.He said   Oh  it must be gun hearings day again   The gun lobby isalways so organized every year.   I got a little pissed  and replied  Im not from the gun lobby    Im from your district. At 12 30  your second reporter arrived in time to notice ademonstration going on in front of the statehouse  where thepro gunners werent .  Randy Price from the TV News was there  in hismirror reflective shades  talking to one of the anti gun types  andseveral Simons Rock anti gun  close the loophole  protestors. Earlier  Randy had covered the GOAL rally. The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember  there wereabout 160 gun owners there  plus another 20 30 students and teachersfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat  the other never gotcloser than the atrium outside    and there was a crowd behind HIM.  Acop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of thecrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started  a loudspeakerwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.Everyone who was there  inside and outside  got to sign up on a sheetsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed upto  support GOALs position  on  all bills. First  because of their time constraints  public officials got totestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen  the studentshad some curfew  I guess .  Currently  Massachusetts law allows a non resident to purchase longguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws ofhis own state.  Previously  the law was similar  but applied only tonon residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simons Rockfolks called the current law a  loophole  and wanted it closed.Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his  SKS assault rifle. The second one  Hodgekiss  a co sponsor  had done his homework so wellthat he kept confusing Montana  Wayne Los home state  with Missouri and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallerycorrected him after his second muff.  Carr  from Gloucester  claimedthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was  but he waslying  the new bill allows purchases by non residents of adjoiningstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state  as strong as that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do  thats that.Some of the things these two said were really offensive.   In some ofthese other states  anyone can buy a gun as long as hes breathing   Oooooo     We have some very  very good gun laws in Massachusetts  ifonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws  we wouldntbe having this situation    but they wont.    Naughty  naughty  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert  Dapper  ONeill.  He wasthere to testify pro gun  but in some ways he was a liability.  Hesreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself  plus hesalmost a caricature of a law n order politician.  He badmouthed theACLU  said violent criminals should be executed  and that if he werejudge  hed give arrestees their  last rights   pun intended  on thespot  at which many of the gun owners applauded  which bothered me. He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in theright direction    for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times    Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind aCCW or FID  and confiscate all your guns  if someone had filed arestraining order against you.   Note that the filing of a restrainingorder requires no warrant  no hearing  no evidence  and no conviction   just an accusation.   Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favorof it  and patronized the pro gunners there several times by saying  Im sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have toget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts haveconvicted.   I havent seen such a disgustingly disingenuousperformance since Nixon whined that he wasnt a crook.Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewableevery five years  instead of permanent as it is now.  The statedpurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. Revenue has nothing to do with it.    Yeah  right.   Apparently  somecongressmen think were stupid enough to swallow the argument thatits preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in thevague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual  hassle thelaw abiding instead of the crook.The two co chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.Jujuga didnt say much  he was a co sponsor of both  restrainingorder  bills  but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldnt let anybad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.   He was a co sponsor of one of the  restraining order  bills as well.   Oneof the younger reps on the committee  forgot his name  wasvociferously pro gun  somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was inthe right place  but his arguments seemed to be confined to   everyyear its the same damn thing  you come in here with this crap... Its nice to have a friend on the committee  but he could have beenmore effective.At about 3 00  it was clear that the hall jam couldnt continue.Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop becausethe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting  so the loudspeaker wasdisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us hadto leave to catch his charter bus  and so missed the  public testimony  the other got a seat this time.Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago  left thestate  and then returned without notifying them of his address change.He complained that the state record system was not up to date and thathis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Greatquote   If you purchase a gun today  it will not get into the statecomputer system until 1999.    This was also an argument he usedagainst the renewable FID card. Testimony was heard from several  battered women   one of whom hadbeen attacked by some guy in his 20s who had an FID card because hegot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion andsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney GeneralHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti gun bill  saying how50 000 restraining orders were granted last year  and how these womenneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order wasgranted for 10 days  and then a hearing was held to determine whetherthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would besatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing ratherthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some longrambling circumlocution in response.Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino  who lookssomething like Einstein  got up and made the point that restrainingorders were issued on too little evidence  that judges like to issuerestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who theythink is right  man or woman   and that the hearings for restrainingorders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.Other pro gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file arestraining order against a tenant to clear her out  and that shecountered by filing one against him   He noted that this would haveallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.One of the junior reps noted that  this is America  and we have to becertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujugareiterated this  saying that  people who abuse smaller people can goto Hell as far as I care  but we have to be careful about equatingconviction with a restraining order.    Point and match  Senator. Another pro gunner got up and testified that he didnt know hiscitizenship  expired every 5 years   and that a drivers license was aprivilege  not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justicesystem  and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and publichangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a deathpenalty bill passed  and joking responded that he  too  favored publichangings.  The speaker then responded   Ill make you a deal.  You getme the rope  and Ill tie the noose. Next came public testimony on the Simons Rock bill.  A teachertestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo  and that  hewouldnt have been able to shoot people inside a building while he wasoutside  without his evil gun.  She said that the  loophole  should beclosed to prevent something like this from  ever happening again .Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill  one ofspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actuallyshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on saying   As long as one person can buy a gun in anger  none of us aresafe    support gun control.   The committee was reluctant to grill orcorrect the kids  except for Caron  who corrected one student who hadclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.   Only residents can getFIDs   he said.   How much do you want to bet that this kid had noidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cutout of staters completely off  Yacino and McNutt spoke again  this time noting that the bill aswritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed byout of staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT  NH  and VT couldbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundarysomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacinounderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a residentstudent    and  hell  even an CCW  as he had NO criminal or mentalrecord.One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buya gun than out of staters  and thought it was  elitist .  Another Caron   said that we need the protection of preventing non residentsfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the unionhad  FID type  cards  so complying with all the laws of ones homestate was  not enough.   One pro gun speaker replied that thisresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming  Everyones out of step but Johnny  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro gun testimonyfor this bill was made  and thus only pro gunners were around when theother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining  andGOALs position  were o  H.4375 and four others  Notify police chiefs so they can pull    licenses when a holder is convicted  strongly supported o  H.1732  Require trigger locks on all handguns sold  opposed o  H.962  Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms  strongly   opposed o  H.1350  Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     opposed o  H.1731  Fund bullet proof vests for municipal police  supported o  S.1097  State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA  supported o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards  opposed o  Several altering non resident license conditions  supported o  H.1135  Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state  guess  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider  as the remainingpro gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.Mike Yacino noted that  besides the danger in screwing with a triggerlock on a loaded gun  that bill would make it illegal for a licenseeto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.Again  he brought up the states archaic records capability and said  This would create hundreds of different licensing systems. The session ran late    since it was the last scheduled hearing  itcould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.

Several others here also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate appears ok for me  but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of spending money  with the size of todays files  etc  a tape backup is certainly worth  200  300.  Recently I set up a friends PC 50Mhz and VESA local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.',\n",

       "  523: 'Organization  Rowan College of New JerseyLines  114Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell  president ofMoody Bible Institute    The other day  I was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing.   It caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing   evangelical Christians  saying we believe in absolutes and think we   are the only ones who know what the absolutes are.   We affirm the absolutes of Scripture  not because we are arrogant   moralists  but because we believe in God who is truth  who has revealed   His truth in His Word  and therefore we hold as precious the strategic   importance of those absolutes. There has been a lot of discussion  but so far nobody seems to have hit onexactly what the criticism of  arrogance  is aimed at.The arrogance being attacked is that we  think we are the only ones who knowwhat the absolutes are .  In short  many evangelicals claim that they areinfallible on the matter of religious texts.In particular  the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand  you canthink of epistemology as  how do you know    That question  it turns out  isa very troubling one.The problem with  absolute certainty is that  at the bottom  at least some ofthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain thateverything which happens in your head is infallible  the reasoning you did todiscover a source of truth is in question.And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source ofauthority    which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.Lets take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy  and a fictionalInerrantist named Zeke.   The following arguments applies to the idea ofPapal Infallibility  too. Zeke has  we presume  spent some time studying the Bible  and history  andseveral other topics.  He has concluded  based on all these studies  andpossibly some religious experiences  that the Bible is a source of AbsoluteTruth.He may be correct  but even if he is  he cannot be certain that he is correct.His conclusion depends on how well he studied history    he may have mademistakes  and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  Hisconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible    he may have mademistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning    and he may have mademistakes.   Noticing a common thread yet   8  Everything about his study of the world that he did    everything thathappened in his own head    is limited by his own thinking.  No matter whathe does to try and cover his mistakes  he can never be certain of his owninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his ownreasoning  that belief cannot be considered  absolutely certain .Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth    but that beliefis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he cansay that his own reasoning is flawless  his conclusions are in doubt.Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part onyour own thinking    there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infalliblethinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.This is easy to demonstrate.  Lets go back to our shorthand method of doingepistemology   how do you know    Imagine a hypothetical discussion  A  The Bible is a source of absolute truth. B  How do you know  A  I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church    teachings and came to this conclusion. B  How do you know you studied history correctly  A  Well  I double checked everything. B  How do you know you double checked correctly  A  Well  I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed. B  Just because some smart guy believes something that doesnt mean it is    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly  A  ...And  as you see  B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say  Icant prove that there are no mistakes     and as long as you may have made amistake  then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.There is no way out of the loop.This is where the  arrogance of Christians  arises  many people believethat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about thedoctrines of Christianity    they are implicitly claiming that they areinfallible  and that there is no possibility of mistake.Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake  and that your thinking has ledyou to a flawless conclusion  is pretty arrogant.  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try tofind _The Infallibility of the Church_  by George Salmon.  He is attackingthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible  and he does so very well  but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible isknowably Inerrant.Darren F Provine   kilroy gboro.rowan.edu At the core of all well founded belief  lies belief that is unfounded.

The  Eastern  Empire continued for another 1000 years  and a key element in its fall was the  Christian  sack of Constantinople.Note that I said the fall of Rome  not of the Empire.  The Roman Empirelasted until 1453  with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  Themain reason for its fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople bythe men of the 4th Crusade  who were not Christians   they had beenexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian cityof Zara in Croatia   but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle ofMazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier  it was only a matterof time before the Empire fell  the inability of the Empire to hold ontothe rim of Anatolia  with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middleshould be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack ofConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greekshad wanted to save their empire  why would they not cooperate with theCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st 3rdCrusades   Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people theyconsidered heretics  even though those  heretics  were fighting for thecause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkishhordes in Anatolia  Edessa  Lebanon  Palastine  and Syria  the somehordes who were to later sack Constantinople  and overrun a third ofEurope  the Balkans  Hungary  the Ukraine  the Caucasus  etc. Andy Byler',\n",

Some of the newer BMWs have electronic odometers making it even more tamperproof.On the cars mentioned   3 series from the late 80s the  electronic odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer  that is drivenby pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer   and speedometer.No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileagereading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy  or hard  tochange as any other mechanical odometer.On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensorand run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simpleswitch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter which will enable the car to reach its full speed.        Alan L.

I guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the  canister.  Meaning  would gases  so far  down the line  the canister  really have an effect on the exhaust stroke   Do the gases really  compress that much     For discussion purposes  I will ignore dynamic effects like pulsesin the exhaust pipe  and try to paint a useful mental picture.1.  Unless an engine is supercharged  the pressure available to forceair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intakevalve is opened  the pressure differential available to move air is onlythe difference between the combustion chamber pressure  left over afterthe exhaust stroke  and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on theintake stroke  combustion chamber pressure is decreased  allowingatmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no timedoes the pressure ever become  negative   or even approach a goodvacuum.2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing  the pressure in thecombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system upto the first major flow restriction  the muffler .  Note that the volumeof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volumethat must flow through the intake  because of the temperaturedifference and the products of combustion.3.  In the last 6 8 years  the Japanese manufacturers have startedpaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning  in pursuit of almightyhorsepower.  At this point in time  on high performance bikes substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almostzero affect on performance  because the stock intake system flows verywell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will makevery little difference  unless  in general  the new exhaust system is_much_ louder than the stocker.4.  On older bikes   exhaust back pressure was the dominating factor.If free flowing air filters were substituted  very little differencewas noted  unless a free flowing exhaust system was installed as well.5.  In general  an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At anygiven RPM  anything that will cause the engine to pump more air  be iton the intake or exhaust side  will cause it to produce more horsepower.Pumping more air will require recalibration  rejetting  of the carburetor.

Rather  I was trying to show the absurdity of atheistic materialist relatavists trying to embrace some common moral system as though it were absolute.  Man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong.  We have all inherited this knowledge.  No matter how  absurd  it is to suggest that a common moral system created bymankind is absolute  it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a commonmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact  for the Bible to be ofany use to mankind as a moral code  it must be interpreted by mankind and aworkable moral system created for everyday use.The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysingevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children ofIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral  Civil  Judicial and CeremonialLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instanceof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian  the situation is no better.It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible  which we can see fromthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear . There may wellbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo Christian God for mankind tofollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept waswritten down by man.This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take thedivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in manydifferent ways  as an example  consider the immolation of heretics in thefifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to dothat to another man under the precept to administer Justice . If we take anagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suitsociety  with all the danger that this implies . Alternatively  we could takethe basis of the Judeo Christian morality and interpret extend this to createand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enablesthe people to live Righteously  as many Christian and Non Christian philosophershave done .Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society  Ithink the important aspect is the result.David.

Q. How do I become an astronaut     A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut  since its probably    impossible for a non Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps  paying    passengers are not professional cosmonauts   and the other nations have    so few astronauts  and fly even fewer  that youre better off hoping to    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet    experience  which means a military flying career  forget that unless you    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle  mission    specialist .    If you arent a US citizen  become one  that is a must.  After that     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly    exceeds the supply.  NASAs problem is not finding qualified people     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough    to be qualified  you must avoid being  dis qualified for any reason     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands    dirty with equipment  not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer    programming entirely  it will be done from the ground for the fore     seeable future.  Degree s  in one field plus work experience in    another seems to be a frequent winner.    Be in good physical condition  with good eyesight.\\t DO NOT get a    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision  nobody knows    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes  and long term    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter  avoid any other    significant medical unknowns.   If you can pass a jet pilot physical     you should be okay  if you cant  your chances are poor.    Practise public speaking  and be conservative and conformist in    appearance and actions  youve got a tough selling job ahead  trying    to convince a cautious  conservative selection committee that you    are better than hundreds of other applicants.   And  also  that you    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired   public relations is    a significant part of the job  and NASAs image is very prim and    proper.   The image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie.    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.    Keep your nose clean.    Get a pilots license and make flying your number one hobby     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs.    Work for NASA  of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988     43 were military or NASA employees  and the remaining two were    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison  the first black female astronaut .    If you apply from outside NASA and miss  but they offer you a job    at NASA     TAKE IT     sometimes in the past this has meant  you    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first .    Think space   they want highly motivated people  so lose no chance    to demonstrate motivation.    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didnt make it the first time.    NASA    National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center    Houston  Texas    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates                                                                          Astronaut Candidate Program                                   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  has a need for    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be    considered.    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in    Houston  Texas  and will involved a 1 year training and evaluation    program.    Space Shuttle Program Description                                         The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into  and maneuvers in    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and    flight crew.    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment    and retrieval of satellites  service of existing satellites  operation    of specialized laboratories  astronomy  earth sciences  materials    processing  manufacturing   and other operations. These missions will    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space    Shuttles capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include    government agencies and private industries.    The crew normally consists of five people   the commander  the pilot     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are    assigned. The commander  pilot  and mission specialists are NASA    astronauts.    Pilot Astronaut    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle     crew  mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition  the    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing    the remote manipulator system  in extra vehicular activities  and other    payload operations.    Mission Specialist Astronaut    Mission specialist astronauts  working with the commander and pilot     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations    in the areas of crew activity planning  consumables usage  and    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems  as well as detailed    knowledge of the operational characteristics  mission requirements and    objectives  and supporting systems and equipment for each of the    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission    specialists will perform extra vehicular activities  payload handling    using the remote manipulator system  and perform or assist in specific    experimental operations.

Application Procedures                              Civilian    The application package may be obtained by writing to \\tNASA Johnson Space Center\\tAstronaut Selection Office\\tATTN  AHX\\tHouston  TX 77058    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA    decides to select additional astronaut candidates  consideration will be    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from    consideration  and their applications will not be retained. After the    preliminary screening of applications  additional information may be    requested for some applicants  and person listed on the application as    supervisors and references may be contacted.    Active Duty Military    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application    procedures will be disseminated by each service.    Selection                 Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.    Once final selections have been made  all applicants who were considered    will be notified of the outcome of the process.    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following    their establishment.    General Program Requirements    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center  Houston     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during    their candidate period.    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a    specified tour of duty.    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.    Therefore  qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.    Pay and Benefits                        Civilians    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS 11 through GS 14     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements    and experience.    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave  a retirement plan  and    participation in group health and life insurance plans.    Military    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center    but will remain in an active duty status for pay  benefits  leave  and    other similar military matters.NEXT  FAQ  15 15   Orbital and Planetary Launch Services',\n",

I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad.  The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator  does not seem like much of a basis for belief.Please forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to followthe argument.My point is that  if life has meaning or importance then we should tryto find that meaning or importance  which is almost a tautology.  I hopeIm not being too patronizing.  One term for that meaning is  Creator  though that is not obvious from my above argument.   And the logic is also appalling   God must exist because I want Him to.  Its more like  I think  therefore I am  therefore God is.     I have heard this line of  reasoning  before and wonder how prevalent  it is. Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is  hopeless  or so the pollsters and newscasts state   but I dont see  where this is a good reason to become religious. If you want meaning  why not just join a cult  such as in Waco  The leaders will give you  the security blanket you desire.Unfortunately the term  religious  is ambiguous to me in this context.I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition beingreligious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on the search.If you want  meaning  why not search for the truth So far  my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understandingof truth.

Im curious why you took a beign statement and cross posted it to several  different news groups  including something along the lines of   alt.discrimination.   Exsqueeze me   I saw  your  original post in alt.discrimination. Your post was cross posted to three groups.  My followup was cross posted to two of those three  omitting soc.motss . Now  instead of engaging in meta discussion off the topic  could you answer  the question posed   If your statement is so  beign       you should have no trouble politely responding to a polite query.       Well  I dont think your query was exactly polite  but I will TRY togive you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net  but here it goes.       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From manyof the newspaper  radio  and tv news reports I have seen  this adjective      is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain aboutthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say thatMr. King was a no good black   I do not know Mr. King and would not make thisascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many   most   news people haveused it in the past.      The entire second trial was about race  Ted.  I dont feel compelled todiscuss Mr. Kings racial background  but had Mr. King been white there wouldnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating wouldnot have occurred if he were white  but that is an extremely difficult callto make.  It is possible the case  but not definately.        I still think your actions are crap  Ted.  They are far more divisive thanme using the adjective black in a non derogenory manner.  Would you havebeen happier if I had used African american    If so  then you really arelost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting onepersons net access revoked  and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.     The way you went about this polite inquiry makes me believe it was anything but. ',\n",

But how do you think property is generated   Does it grow automatically  on trees when we wish so  or someone has to produce it  Some say it was generated by God or Goddess  some say it was the result ofthe coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.      It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not  provide us automatically with our needs Oh   When did She  stop    Mother Nature has been automatically providingus with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  Itis not  produced   it produces itself  year after year.  Last night  forexample  I saw four deer crossing the road  pretty sight  too   in anearlier time  one of them would have been dinner.  There are 2 ways to go with produced things  the first is to   _trade_ it with the the person s  who produced it.   The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced  it. The first way is the civilized method  the second is how savages  arrange their affairs.The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property  and oftenfreely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes  trading food andclothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians  like theirPolynesian ancestors  also could not conceive of that idea  and sharedmany things with the other Islanders.  In fact   hiipoi   the Hawaiianword for  cherish  means  sharing food .  The Great Mahele  in whichthe Islands were divided up more or less evenly between the rich andthe poor  was a white mans idea.  In Africa  villagers will oftenshare tools  crops  and clothing with other members of their own villageand neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been toAfrica has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so called  theft  of the scientists possessions    two concepts of which until the visitors came along  the natives had no understanding.These are the people we call  savages .On the other hand  car jackings and muggings are up from last year.Dov  before you make further comment on this thread  I think it wouldbehoove you to study  all  of the facts. garison',\n",

I hate to follow up to my own posting  but I should perhaps clarifysome things so I wont get flamed.First of all  when Im talking about   factoring the modulus or a  breakthrough in factoring  what I really mean is a breakthrough inthe cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA arenot proven to be equivalent  its just so damn convenient not torepeat this every time.I also have to admit that I dont really know if the   non groupproperty of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I havethought about it a little while  but I cant find a way that acryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That  of course  meansnothing at all.Then I wrote  Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus than it is to generate it  the increase in computer speed alone will keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock step  i.e.  people will simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of thecryptanalyst is a faster computer  then we will probably have RSA fora long time to come  because even if 1024 bit moduli somehow could bebroken with fast computers  not with a new algorithm   then peoplewould simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefitfrom better technology in the same way.Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.   Stephan  neuhaus informatik.uni kl.de sig closed for inventory.

We all compromise and rationalize poor choices  sin .  Last  week I was guilty of anger  jealousy  and whole mess of other stuff   yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with AIDs.  To even  suggest that AIDS is  deserved  is ludicrous.  Some rules are made because at some point man is too stupid to know better. Yet  eventually man learns. But only after getting a lesson from experience.Yes  its important to realize that all actions have consequences and that  rules  were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a disease  is a  punishment  for certain types of sin I think is taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth diseasefor lying  would any of us have mouths left   What if we developedblindness every time we lusted after someone or something   I daresay all of us would be walking into walls.  I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didnt get involved in deviant sexual behaviour. Certainly  people who received tainted blood are not to blame. But it just goes to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few.Yes  sin can have terrible consequences  but we need to be  real careful when saying that the consequences are a  punishment  for sin.  The Jews of Jesuss time believed that all sickness was theresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man wasblind to show the glory of God  not because of sin.  If AIDS  or anyother STD is a  punishment  for sexual sin  what do we do with diseases like cancer  or multiple sclerosis  which are just asdebilitating and terrible as AIDS  yet are not usually linked to aspecific behavior or lifestyle   In addition  IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS   I dont know.Atonement is  extremely  important  but I think youve missed the markabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST   period.  This is the centralmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for  all  ofour sins  past present and future.  God does not require pennance forour sins  nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  Hehas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spittingon the sacrifice that Jesus made.In case you couldnt tell  I get  extremely  angry and upset whenI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears andphobias  we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and othersocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease throughtheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ no more and no less than we do.  Ive said this before  but I thinkits a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern day lepers.  Jesushealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS  maybe not onthis earth  but in an ultimate sense.  My next door neighbor has AIDS.She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with God.  Her theology isnt what I would want it to be but Gods grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gainingweight  shes had the disease for over 2 years  and her health isexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributesher improvement in her health to Gods intervention in her life.  Whoare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment   Itseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.Paul Overstreet  the country singer  has a good song title that I think applies to all of us   But for the Grace of God  There Go I or something like that .May we all experience and accept Gods grace.

On the 10th I had got my crew  done the paper work  and left for the Zhdanov District. Thats in Azerbaijan  near theNagorno Karabagh region.After the 14th  rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh  specificallyin Stepanakert  an uprising had taken place. They said  uprising  inAzerbaijani  but I dont think it was really an uprising  just a demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured  They were beaten  even women  it was said that they were at the demonstrations  but they live here  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. Therewere some conversations about Armenians among the local population  theArmenians had done this  the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true  the guys from my crew wouldnt let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really bad. I didnt know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me  Theres unrest everywhere  be careful.  Well I had a project going on. I toldthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldnt allow it  they said   Nothings going to happen to you  weve entrusted the matter to the police  weve warned everyone in the district  nothing will happen to you.  Well  in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me  he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. Thisman didnt leave me alone for five minutes  he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us  too.I sense some disquiet and call home  my wife also tells me   The situation isvery tense  be careful. We finished the job at the site  and I left for Sumgait first thing on themorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me  they told me that Ishouldnt tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone elsesbusiness travel documents  in the name of Zardali  and hid my own. I hid it and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus  they sat behind  and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said thatthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out they knew what was happening in Sumgait.I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait isclosed  there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the buses arent running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every twominutes. And suddenly  no buses. Well  we tried to get there via privatedrivers. One man  an Azerbaijani  said   Lets go find some other way to getthere.  They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver totake us to Sumgait.He took us there. But the others had said   I wouldnt go if you gave me athousand rubles.   Why    Because theyre burning the city and killing theArmenians. There isnt an Armenian left.  Well I got hold of myself so I couldstill stand up. So we squared it away  the four of us got in the car  and we set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says   In fact there arent anyArmenians left. They burned them all  beat them all  and stabbed them.  Well I was silent. The whole way  20 odd miles  I was silent. The driver asks me   How old are you  old man   He wants to know  if Im being that quiet  not saying anything  maybe it means Im an Armenian.  How old are you   he asks me. I say   Im 47.   Im 47 too  but I call you old man.  I say   It depends on God  each persons life in this world is different.  I look mucholder than my years  thats why he called me old man. Well after that he wassilent  too.Were approaching the city  I look and see tanks all around  and a cordon.Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well  hewas waving his hand  we all start waving our hands. Im sitting there withthem  I start waving my hand  too. I realized that this was a sign that meantthere were no Armenians with us.I look at the city  there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street  you know  and theres no traffic. Well probably I was scared. Theystopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature shafts  and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .Along the way the driver tells us how they know whos an Armenian and whos not. The Armenians usually . . . For example  Im an Armenian  but I speak their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  nut   or  little nut   as  pundukh   but  fundukh  is actually correct. The pronunciations are different. Anyone who says  pundukh   even if theyre not Armenian  they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says   There was a car there  with five people inside it   he says.  They started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didnt let thepeople out   he says   they wouldnt let them get out of the car.  I only saw the car  but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives fromBaku to Sumgait and back . . .When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and theres a short guy his eyes are gleaming  he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone inthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one.  WereAzerbaijani  they tell him  no Armenians here.  He did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says   Maybe youre an Armenian  old man   But in Azerbaijani I say   You should be ashamed of yourself   And . . . he left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do  I had to . . . the city was on fire  but I had to steal my children out of my own home.They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street  thats where the Kavkaz store and three large  12 story buildings are. Thats the beginning of down town. I saw that burned automobile there  completely burned  only metal remained. I couldnt figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing remained of them  not even any traces. That driver had told me about it  and Isaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton  a metallic carcass. About30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.I see a military transport  an armored personnel carrier. The hatches areclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it  thecrowd is. And I hear shots  not automatic fire  its true  but pistol shots.Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city  cordoning off Sumgait.I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by their gait that theyre not bandits  theyre just people  walking home. Ijoined them so in case something happened  in case someone came up to usand asked questions  either of us would be in a position to answer  you see.But I avoided the large groups because Im a local and might be quickly recognized. I tried to keep at a distance  and walked where there were fewerpeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2  which is across from our block.I cant get into our block  but I walked where there were fewer people  so as to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking behind him. And hes shouting into a megaphone   Comrades  the Armenian Azerbaijani war has begun  The police have megaphones like that. So theyre talking and walking around the second microdistrict. I see that theyre coming my way  and turn off behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on everycorner  and at the middles of the buildings  and at the edges. What they were doing I cant say  because I couldnt get up close to them  I was afraid. But the most important thing was to get away from there  to get home  and at leastfind out if my children were alive or not . . .

Creps  writes  In article  Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313 athos.rutgers.edu  jemurray magnus.acs.ohio state.edu  John E Murray  writes      On Palm Sunday at our parish  we were  invited  to take the role of Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins  so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd  but to no avail.   musicians  readers  and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the  liturgy and since no one knows whats happening  the new things have to be  explained  and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass were just  sitting there listening  or spacing out  in my case  to how the Mass is about  to be done.  In my mind  I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay  people to be aware of the Lords presence.As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran   it is some of the innovations  of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and returnto the more traditional Catholic Chuch   the Lutherans.I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate inthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish justinstituted the  Tenebrae  service for Good Friday and I was the lector for a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned thingsthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels   yet those  facts  werealways there.  As a matter of interest  the pastor and I were talking aboutthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week overbreakfast Easter Sunday.     As a member of a liturgy committee  I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating  who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests dont seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess its easier to  try something new  than it is to refuse to allow it.My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family  called musicand worship at our church .  Our pastor does have control of this committeebut listens very carefully to the committees suggestions.  It needs a stronghand to lead and guide  to keep the intent and the message clear and strongas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additionalreason for my leaving the Catholic faith   lack of any selfless spiritualguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA  wishy washy . As you may gather from my comments  I feel that it is very important  ir regardless of denominational guidelines  to have a service Mass which promotesthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in atraditional Mass  with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue  the Sacramentof PENANCE  not Reconciliation   Stations of the Cross  so on and so forth.The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelingsare not shared by everyone.I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord  but I dont want them attending a show.  Its not.  My church works hard to have a meaningfulservice during Lent on Wednesdays  but follow traditional Lutheran Book ofWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent  suchas the Hymn of Praise  it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that itis Not there.Quite frankly  it is very hard for a non Catholic to go to a Mass and  fit in .My dear wife never could  former Methodist .  And Holy Week Masses and Vigilswould intimidate the daylights out of a non Catholic.  Those Catholics whohave beared with me this far understand what I mean.Please keep in mind why we are there   to gather together in worship.  Notto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is somethingwrong that you feel needs addressing  by all means talk to your priest orpastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldnt listen.  They are there to provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences withthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental   but my decision to changefaiths was done with prayer  intervention  and sessions with priests andministers.In Christ Kershner   Kershner Wyattkwyatt ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.comMy opinions are my own and arent necessarily my employers.',\n",

There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do   any other graphics in Linux without X windows   I love Linux because it is   so easy to learn..  You want text   Okay.   Use Linux. You want text AND   graphics   Use Linux with X windows.  Simple.  Painless.  REQUIRED to have   X Windows if you want graphics   This includes fancy word processors like   doc  image viewers like xv  etc.   Sorry  Bryan  this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comeswith Linux SLS  It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode  without  Xwindows.So at least it is  possible  to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I dontthink that there exists a similar SVGA package  and viewing GIFs in 320x200 isnot very nice.Best Regards Arno                                                                                   Arno Schaefer\\t\\t\\t\\tENSIMAG  2e AnneeEmail  schaefer silene.imag.frTel.   33  76 51 79 95\\t\\t\\t                                                                                   ',\n",

Id especially like to know what  happened immediately after the defense attorney asked that question   assuming that the reports that he did so are accurate... Im not  accusing Tom Farrell of making anything up  but this _is_ the sort of  case that spawns garbled misquotes  false rumors and urban legends like  tribbles .  Itd be nice to think that the prosecutor objected   irrelevant  prejudicial  inflammatory... take your pick  and that the  judge upheld the objection. I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.   Theywere talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips .  Immediatelyafter the defense attorney asked the question  there was an  Objection   heardin the background.  The clip ended at that point so I dont know if theobjection was upheld.  I cant imagine NC is  that  bad.    The arresting officer said the bastards told him they did it on   purpose and hoped the victim would die  and you think the defense made   a good case      No wonder were losing   Were aparently not trying   to win     Again  Id like to see the transcript... Id read the latter bit of that  in the news media  the arresting officer testifying that one of the  defendants calmly asked him about the condition of the  homo  and said  that he hoped hed die  but this is the first Ive heard of the officer  testifying that one of the defendants actually said that he did anything  at all  let alone that he did it on purpose. This I didnt hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times onnews stories both during and after the trial.  Now the  we did it on purpose thing is stretching  I think it was something more like  he had it coming.  Ifsomebody else remebers better than I on this second point  feel free toclarify.

Moral systems must be consistent.A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others  but doesnt want it inflicted upon themselves  has a double standard.  And double standards area violation of  any  moral system. me  Morality defines how we interact with other people  the rules that we use to guide our daily affairs.  Our conduct towards our fellow man.  By realizing that we dont like pain  we can also realize that other people dont like it  either.    hudson  Of course we dont like pain.  I dont like brussel sprouts.  Are brussel sprouts immoral Pain isnt immoral  stupid.  Pain itself is just a physiologicalreaction.  What   is   immoral is subjecting unwilling individuals to pain.Or brussel sprouts  for that matter. hudson   Is it immoral to produce these same chemical reactions in a test tube   me  It isnt the chemical reaction that is wrong  bozo.  Its making the human being UNDERGO THE EFFECTS of the chemical reaction.  Sorry  your cute little analogy didnt survive for very long under scrutiny.  hudson  Why would it be wrong to make humans undergo the effects of the reactions if humans are composed only of matter   What humans are composed of isnt the qualifying criteria of whether ornot something would be wrong.    hudson  Is it wrong to make matter undergo chemical reactions Yes  if it is sentient matter.  me   Nature is not a sentient force  there is no choice involved.  Therefore   no question of morality.  hudson  I actually heard a geologist entertain the notion that matter had a will. There is some sentient force out there.  Fine.  I have also heard that the government is encoding the DNA for a new race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water.  Whats your point   hudson  If humans are made only of matter  then choices are also chemical reactions  so why is choice an important issue.And if that is the case  then god is only an idea contained in the mindsof people  formed of matter  and on printed pages  also formed of matter and does not really exist.

Statement of Sarah Brady Regarding Texas State Carrying Concealed Legislation  To  State Desk  Contact  Susan Whitmore of Handgun Control Inc.  202 898 0792     WASHINGTON  March 25    Following is a statement of Sarah  Brady regarding Texas state carrying concealed legislation       A handful of lawmakers in Austin today have told the public that their safety is of less importance than the interests of the National Rifle Association.  This action comes as local  state and federal law enforcement officials continue their stand off with a religious cult that has highlighted the need for tougher gun laws  not weaker ones like the carry concealed bill.    A handful of anti gun zealots are telling the public that theirright to self defense is of less importance than the interests ofHandgun Control  Inc.  This action comes as local  state and federal lawenforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidiancompound  an assault which has already resulted in the death of onetwo year old child at the hands of federal agents.  This has highlightedthe need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their childrenagainst the excesses of their own government.      Any suggestion by proponents that this bill will help to reduce crime is a distortion of the facts  at best.  This so called crime fighting law has resulted in a 16 percent increase in violent crime in the state of Florida  and I have never heard law enforcement officials bragging that more guns on the streets is the way to reduce crime.   Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a distortion of the facts  at best.  The aggressive outreach by officialsin central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop inthe level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course  this program isa rare gem  as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that anunarmed citizenry will be easier to control  and thus favor tighter restrictions.      The vote today is an insult to the law enforcement officials who are putting their lives on the line every day to end the standoff in Waco.  The entire country now knows just how easy it is for an individual bent on destruction to amass an arsenal of weapons.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total disregard for those law officials on the front lines  and the families of those who have fallen.    The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at largewho are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about theirlawful affairs.  The entire country knows how vulnerable the average citizen is  both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by ourown police.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill haveshown total understanding for those innocent  law abiding citizens on thefront lines  and the families of those who have fallen.      I urge the House of Representatives to listen to the 70 percent of Texans that oppose this measure  and reject this ill conceived legislation.     I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needsof their constituents  and not be stampeded by ill conceived argumentsfrom ideological fanatics.    30       Nigel Allen  Toronto  Ontario     nigel.allen canrem.com    Canada Remote Systems   Toronto  Ontario 416 629 7000 629 7044 Aint propaganda fun                                                                                  The opinions expressed by the author are insightful  intelligent and verycarefully thought out.

Furthermore  any use of RSA  other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law  is similarly unlawful.  Therefore  the  average citizen  cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.WRONG   I dont think even PKP claims this one.

Are all truths also absolutes     Is all of scripture truths  and therefore absolutes         The answer to both questions is yes.  Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me  an absolute is something that is constant across time  culture  situations  etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition   I think you do     Similarly  all truth is absolute.  Indeed  a non absolute truth is a    contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute   When it is always   true.  Obviously  if a  truth  is not always  true  then we have a   contradiction in terms.  I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is  practically speaking  awaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is  in fact relative.For example  I recently was asking some children the question  What temperaturedoes water boil at    I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I askedif they knew what scale  and was told  Its just 212 degrees.  Any scale.Thats what all thermometers say.   Well  thats sincere  and may betrue in the experience of the speaker  but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOTan absolute truth.  Similarly  Scripture is full of Truth  which we shouldnurture and cherish  but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truthand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the timeand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religioneasily becomes an intellectual head trip  devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism  IMO.  example of head covering in Church deleted This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind thewriting  but the simplest understanding of the passage is that theinstructions apply to the Corinthians  and not necessarily elsewhere.The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of firstcentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth  which was havinga LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me   No.  And I see no compelling  or even reasonable  reason that it should be.  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.   And there are plenty of other examples.  Can you reconcile this Even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.Ive yet to meet anyone who takes the verse  blessed is he who takes yourbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks  literally.  The Biblewas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell uswhat parts should be interpreted which way.     Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a   statement is terribly self contradictory.  Let me put it to you this   way.  If there are no absolutes  shouldnt we conclude that the statement     There are no absolutes  is not absolutely true   Obviously  we have a   contradiction here.  I dont claim that there are  no  absolutes.  I think there are very few  though  and determining absolutes is difficult.I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them  personally  we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference  since Iknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.     There is hardly consensus  even in evangelical     Christianity  not to mention the rest of Christianity  regarding     Biblical interpretation.      So   People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate    the fact  however  that there are still absolutes in the universe.  I cant prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.I also trust Gods revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.Therefore we cant comprehend the Absolutes.  So I dont need them.  I can never know the essence of God  only the energies by and through whichGod is manifested to Gods creation.  So the reality can be that there AREabsolutes  but it is of no practical importance.  Its like claiming that theoriginal scriptural autographs were perfect  but copies may not be.  Swell.Who cares   It doesnt affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens  and that theylive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what  Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor  or God   Whether or not I go to this or thatcafeteria for lunch   No.  This attitude leads many non Christians to believe that ALL Christiansare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason  since Reason is an innerreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simplyappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.NOTE   Im NOT claiming there is no place for authority. Thatd be silly.       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program    Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me   with XOpenWindow There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw  motif  orGlxDraw  athena  widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea  except that itallows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink glxunlink  glxgetconfig  and glxwinset in the man pages.   I have never used GL before  but the doc on GL winopen   says that the first   time winopen   is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also  most of   the GL calls do not require a Display or GC  unlike most X calls.  From this   initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this   true The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.   Does PEX  graPHIGS   have the same functionality of GL I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful  butthats just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.   Larry D.

Mahan  says   Why should a good driver be terrified at 130mph  The only thing I fear  going at 130 are drivers  who switch to the left lane without using  either rear view mirror or flashers. Doing 130 to 150 aint a rush  for me  but its fun and I get where I want to go much faster.  In defense of the drivers  who are in the right lane.  Here in the states  people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50 mph.  I dont think this is because they are stupid  of course  there are exceptions   they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you  in the states  when you look in the rear view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50  speed differential.   Dont get me wrong  I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake cars who are on the right  I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car  to recognize the speed differential  I would be the stupid one.  just to satiate my curiosity  why would this make you the stupid one   It seemsto me  everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not needto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a littlemore.  If you glance around  you will be able to tell how much faster than youthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely  but well enough to know if you shouldlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about about the other driver being startled  because i myself have been startledby drivers cruising by at around 90 100mph when im doin 55 65.

       "  634: 'Lines  84In article  May.5.02.52.15.1993.28800 athos.rutgers.edu  JEK cu.nih.gov writes  Gerry Palo writes      ...there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of    repeated lives on earth.  The Apostle Paul  Romans 9 11  points out that God chose Jacob rather than Esau to be the ancestor of the Covenant People and ultimately of the Messiah  and that He made this choice while the two boys were still in their mothers womb  and therefore could not possibly have done anything good or evil to deserve their appointed destinies. If we admit the possibility that they had lived previous lives  and that  in accordance with the Asiatic idea of  karma   their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour  this makes nonsense of Pauls whole point. The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny  karma  does notmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction  but Idid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual overanother as the fit instrument for his plans  but that does notpreclude that the development of that individual into what he is inthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.I do not  and Rudolf Steiner did not  subscribe to the oriental viewof an inexorable  mechanistic karma determining everything thatbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greaterlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and theultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working ofChrist can be seen as the master theme and  indeed  a new impulse thatwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in theflesh  and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The orientalconcepts of reincarnation and karma  which are even more trivializedand mechanized in some new age teachings  incorrectly assume JesusChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar  etc.Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept thecontinuing individuality from one life to the next  e.g. Buddhism .More important  they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human being    to ultimateresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is thetenth chapter of John  devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.Clearly here  Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karmaor that of his parents that led to his blindness  but rather that anew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does notrefute the disciples question.  In fact  they ask it as a matter ofcourse  the question being stated as if it were self evident that onlyone of two possibilities existed   it was either the sins of the manhimself  obviously not in this incarnation  or the sins of hisparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility atall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form ofChrists answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.There is also Matthew 11 14  where Jesus says straight out about Johnthe Baptist     If you care to accept it  he himself is Elias  who was to come. This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teachingeither way about reincarnation    or  in fact  about what happens tothe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus didnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it   Ifyou care to accept it  .  So I took care to point out  not that theBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either  andthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomesunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  Ipointedly used  repeated earth lives  to distinguish a little from theoriental doctrines usually associated with the word  reincarnation .The phrase is Rudolf Steiners  wiederholte Erdenleben .  He noted toothat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west  completelyfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies  the most important expression of it being Lessings  TheEducation of the Human Race .To return to your original point  Pauls statement about Jacob andEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in theincarnation  death  and resurrection  ascension and return of JesusChrist  in my view.Regards  Gerry Palo  73237.2006 compuserve.com ',\n",

The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday      by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than      the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional      wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  1  So what So there are less gays  then the gays claim.  2  It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers    gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of    us then this is an event unprecidented in history... Dream on.  Abortion and African American Civil rights rallies dont even bringin half of that.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.  The median number of sexual partners for all men 20 39 was 7.3.  Dont forget that 25  had 20 or more partners.... I was wondering why I wasnt getting laid.  Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters  Johnson   and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners  it is apparent that  homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general  male population.  And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those who said they where homosexual  Or is that number to inconvient for you.... If its more  then who cares   Its a shame that we dont have a breakdown for  straight men vs. gay bi men    that would show even more dramatically  how much more promiscuous gay bi men are.  Fuck off Actually  I bet you more gay bi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men  because more of them could have the  option  of living a straight life  and with social pressures  probably would at least try.

The Old Testament was very big on the  eye for an eye  business.  It makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to  repay  moral wrongdoing.Brian K.  guess what   You missed the point.  On a scale from cold tohot  you are at 0 degrees Kelvin. I know about sanctification.  Ive been taught all about it in Sunday school  catechism class  and theology classes.  But even after all that  I still cant accept it.  Maybe Im still not understanding it  or maybe Im just understanding it all too well.Then as you understand it  what is it  From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent man is wrong.Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus Punishment you say   Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.  Ive tried repeatedly over the course of several years to accept it  but I just cant. Good.  I wouldnt either  not the way you understand it.   If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a  good  thing  then I would be very glad to hear it  and you might even convert me. Be warned  however  that Ive heard all the most common arguments before  and they just dont convince me.Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12 23 32.  Itisnt a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need fora persuasive argument.   Read Jesuss own reply to yourquestion.Jesus gives more reasons in John 16 7.  But one obvious reasonwhy Jesus died   and as with everything else  it has nothing do withhis punishment  was that he could rise to life again  so thatwe would  stop doubting and believe   John 21 27 .  The factthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will risefrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.Without this obvious point  I would have no hopeand my faith would be vanity.Why did Jesus suffer in his death   Again  ask Jesus.  Jesussays why in John 15 18 25.   Thats no mystery either.   Theworld hates him without reason.   It is a direct proclamationof how far we humans botch things up and thus  how much weneed a Saviour.And why cant you  Brian K.  accept this   How can you    Theworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knowshim.    John 14 17 .   The animosity and the lack of knowledgethat comes out in your twistings of Roberts daily verses isvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14 17 and 16 25.I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack ofknowledge. I am not perfect either.

If we are going to get anywhere in this  or any  discussion  it doesnt help to bring up elements I never addressed   nor commented on in any way . I made no comment on who is  right  or who is  wrong   only that civilians ARE being used as cover and that  having been placed  in between  the Israelis and the guerillas they  will  be injured as both parties continue their fight. \\t The  purpose  of an armys use of military uniforms \\tis  to set its members apart  from the civilians so that \\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\\t combatants . So  what do you think is the  meaning behind   \\tthe intention and the effect when an  army  purposely \\t does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to  look \\tlike civilians   They are judging that the benefit they will \\treceive from this  cover  is more important that the harm\\tthat will come to civilians. This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is sayingthat the guerillas  do  have some responsibility in putting civiliansin  the middle  of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apartfrom civilians  barracks  etc.   the guerillas would significantly lowerthe risk to civilians.\\tBut if the guerillas do this arent  they  putting themselves\\tat greater risk  Absolutely  they ask themselves  why set \\tourselves apart  by wearing uniforms  when there is a ready made \\tcover for us  civilians   That makes sense from their point of \\tview  BUT when this cover is used  the guerillas should accept \\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.  If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel  is it not working  Why  is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages  Why   not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone  You see  there   is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION...    GETTING BACK ... GETTING EVEN . It doesnt make sense to shell the   villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli   government for the lives of civilians.I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israels bombingsortees and bombing policy is stupid  thoughtless  inhumane ANDineffective. BUT  there is no reason that Israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act  there is every reason to believe that taking the fight  to  the enemy  will do more to stop attacks. As I said previously  Israel spent several decades  sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks  after the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didnt work very well.The  host  Arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attackswere considerably higher  as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path.       What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states     can start all over again  While I also hope for this to happen  it will    only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are  prepared  to take on the     responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their     soil. They have to Prove it  or provide some  guaratees    there is no way    Israel is going to accept their  word   not with their past attitude of     tolerance towards  anti Israel guerillas in residence .      If Israel is not willing to accept the  word  of others then  IMHO  it has  no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks. This is just another  selectively applied  statement. The reason for this drawn out impasse between Ababs Palestinians and Israelisis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By yourcriteria  everyone  should stay away from the negotiations.That is precisely why the Palestinians  in their recent PISGA proposal for the  interim  period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy  aredemanding conditions that essentially define  autonomy  already. They DONOT trust that Israel will  follow through  the entire process and allowPalestinians to reach full autonomy. Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians  If you do  then why should Israels view of Arabs Palestinians be any different  Why should they trust the Arab Palestinians words Since they dont  they are VERY reluctant to give up  tangible assets  land  control of areas  in exchange for  words . For this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of  guarantees  they will have that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  But dont you see that the same statement can be made both ways  If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Absolutely  so are the Arabs Palestinians asking FIRST for theIsraelis  word  in relation to any agreement  NO  what is beingdemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND  and one partyfinally gets HOLD of this  land   what the  other party  doesis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power  whether Israel chooses tokeeps its word does NOT get the land back. Afterall  Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from  areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   Tim  you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been  disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does  not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up  Sheikh Mosavi  his wife  and young son. While the  major armaments   those allowing people to wage  civil wars  have been removed  the weapons needed to cross border attacks stillremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue  and  commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregardfor human life  yours of that of others . Such attacks also continue.  Of course  if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon  and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldnt  make the Lebanese so mad as to do that.Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attackswere commonplace. Furthermore  with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed  it would not be possible.There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively  disarmed  UNLESS the stateis as authoritarian is Syrias. The only other way is for Lebanon to takeit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel  essentiallymirroring Israels border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL thatit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.     Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain     control  If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.      Tim  when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border   Not lately  eh Thats what I said  ok  But  doesnt that mean that Syria has to  take over Lebanon  I dont think Israel or Lebanon would like that.  What both  sides  need is to receive something  tangible . The Arabs Palestinians are looking for  land  and demanding that they receive itprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems  1  if itgives up real  land  it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategicsituation  and that change doesnt help Israels position   and 2  WHENit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return tocompensate for the increased risksTim',\n",

Huh    How do you rate public floggings or floggings at all  Chopping off the   hands  heads  or other body  parts  What about stoning   I dont have a problem with floggings  particularly  when the offenders  have been given a chance to change their behavior before floggings are  given. I do have a problem with maiming in general  by whatever means.  In my opinion no one who has not maimed another should be maimed. In  the case of rape the victim _is_ maimed  physically and emotionally   so I wouldnt have a problem with maiming rapists. Obviously I wouldnt  have a problem with maiming murderers either. May I ask if you had the same opinion before you became a Muslim Sure. Yes  I did. You see I dont think that rape and murder shouldbe dealt with lightly. You  being so interested in leniency forleniencys sake  apparently think that people should simply betold the  did a _bad_ thing.  And what about the simple chance of misjudgements Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.I suspect that its pretty unlikely that  given my requirementof repeated offenses  that misjudgments are very likely.        Orient  is not a place having a single character. Your ignorance      exposes itself nicely here.     Read carefully  I have not said all the Orient shows primitive machism.    Well then  why not use more specific words than  Orient   Probably    because in your mind there is no need to  its all the same .   Because it contains sufficient information. While more detail is possible    it is not necessary.  And Europe shows civilized bullshit. This is bullshit. Time to put out  or shut up. Youve substantiated nothing and are blabbering on like   Islamists  who talk about the West as the  Great Satan.  Youre both  guilty of stupidities. I just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers not to call each others names. In this case  to substantiate it  The Quran allows that one beATs ones wife into submission. Really  Care to give chapter and verse  We could discuss it. Primitive Machism refers to that.  I have misspelt that before  my fault . Again  not all of the Orient follows the Quran. So youll have to dobetter than that.Sorry  you havent  put out  enough.    Islam expresses extramarital sex. Extramarital sex is a subset of sex. It is   suppressedin Islam. That marial sexis  allowed or encouraged in Islam  as   it is in many branches of Christianity  too  misses the point.   Read the part about the urge for sex again. Religions that run around telling   people how to have sex are not my piece of cake for two reasons  Suppressing   a strong urge needs  strong measures  and it is not their business anyway.  Believe what you wish. I thought you were trying to make an argument.  All I am reading are opinions.  It is an argument. That you doubt the validity of the premises does not change it. If you want to criticize it  do so. Time for you to put up or shut up.This is an argument for why _you_ dont like religions that suppresssex. A such its an irrelevant argument.If youd like to generalize it to an objective statement then fine. My response is then  you have given no reason for your statementthat sex is not the business of religion  one of your  arguments  .The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strongmeasures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is sostrong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort tofind a marriage partner.Gregg',\n",

       "  649: 'Keywords  SuccessLines  140Nntp Posting Host  ccsua.ctstateu.eduOrganization  Yale University  Department of Computer Science  New Haven  CTI told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI andthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to theirstupidity and lies.    Now before everyone gets crazy with me  let me say that Koresh was crazy as a bed bug  but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and intotown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didnt pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.First  they didnt see him.  What kind of survaillance is that   Second  theydidnt care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they gotit.After the first battle  they told us that they did not know he knew they werecoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.Well  we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige   According tothem they did  but according to the Hartford Courant  the woman that raisedKoresh  His Grandmother  was not allowed to go in and see him.                  The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper hesaid  A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.His grandmother raised Vernon Howell   Koreshs Real name   she didnt raiseDavid Koresh. Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on alogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.Heres another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming thatthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something mustbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about howmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the  Justification  partpart of the plan.  Thats when I knew it would come soon.But  back to the plan.  It is considered  Cruel and Unusal Punishment  toexecute criminals in the minds of many people  but look at whats acceptable.They knew the parents  adults  had gas masks.  They did not know  or were notsure  if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the compound.  The mothers  seeing what the gas was doing to their children weresupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR Chemical  Biological Radiological  warfare training.  Part of that trainingis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children weresubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind ofthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan  the final solution.We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave thesepeople 51 days.  I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this wholething that the government could point to as a success.  Well  FBI agent Rickschanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant  And while expressing regret at the loss of life  he suggested that theoperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federalshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt. It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automaticweapons on the premises.

There is no such thing as non toxic tear gas.  Tear gas is non breathable      remaining in its presence will cause nausea and vomiting  followed eventually      by siezures and death.  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people      they exposed    Any potential heart problems among the B Ds      No doubt it is dangerous stuff when concentrated.    2.  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister    Tear gas is produced by burning a      chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a       warning printed on the side of it.   Contact with flamable material can result      in fire.   Now  how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building       they admited was a fire trap      None.  They used non incindiary methods  which means they produced the gas   outside the building and pumped it in via the tanks.

If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  Gods will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as its head.  Just like the Jewish people expected . If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what\\t.\\t.\\t.Why do you assume that Jesuss plea to His Father  to let this cuppass from Him   was merely a plea to escape death   When I look atJesus in the garden  I see a Man God  who all His life had had thepresense of His Father with Him.  As a result  He knew everydetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  Butas that hour approached  He felt abandoned by His Father  Hispresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition  itwas brought more and more to Jesuss attention  the betrayal ofJudas was probably a big impact  that His suffering would be to noavail for many people  especially those who would reject Him  notonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority ofJesuss suffering was mental and spiritual  while the physicalportion was only the tip of the iceburg.BTW  we know from Johns account that Jesus  shunned  becomming an earthlyking.  From John JOH 6 14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did  they            began to say   Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the            world. JOH 6 15    Jesus  knowing that they intended to come and make him king by            force  withdrew again to a mountain by himself.This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming anearthly king.  No  Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all  Jew  Gentile  people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of thosewho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken  much to Jesussdismay  as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knewwhat His Fathers will was and followed it obediently even in thedarkness of His Passion.

Does anyone know what he was referring to I dont want to get into a semantic argument  but contrary to some otherpostings  near UV light   is   actual UV light.   The  near  means thatit is close to the visible spectrum  i.e. of relatively long wavelength  not that it is  nearly UV.    Im sure you can figure out now just what far UV  is. Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in thenear end of the spectrum  such that a filter can be used to remove thevisible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources aregoing to require gas  probably mercury vapor  discharge tubes  such asfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor .  Be careful  though  strong UVsources can cause physiological damage  especially to the eyes.  Theshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.It wouldnt project a beam like a flashlight  but replacing the tubesin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relativelycheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough tobe useful  but not dangerously so.\\t\\t Ed Hall\\t\\tedhall rand.org',\n",

The only relevance here is that you dont seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is  and when it is murder.  That is  when you tell us murder is wrong  you are using a term you have not yet defined.Well  Ive said that when an innocent person has been executed  this isobjectively a murder.  However  who is at blame is another question.It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions  realizing the risks  is to blame. There is a  probability  of  killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air  and  there is a  probability  of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment.  So when you do either  you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or  later result in the killing of an innocent person.Yes  but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doingany raondom activity.  Presumably  you had not isolated yourself totallyfrom the rest of society because of this.  And  driving will kill people  as will airlines  but people continue to do  both. Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by Courts.  They are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly.And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocentperson will be punished someday  but we work to prevent this.  In fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishmentof innocents. If our own driving kills someone else  then sure  there is a moral issue.  I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident  and they felt vey guilty afterwards.But  such accidents are to be totally expected  given the numner of vehicalson the road.  Again  the blame is on society.  No Im not.  This is what you said.  You were saying that if there were such  a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed    it would still be the fault of the state  since it did the actual killing. No  I just commented that the state does the killing.  It does not depend on there being false witnesses.  How could it   The state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakesYes  but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only doso much to prevent false witnesses.  It is possible.  So  what are you trying to say  that capital punishment  is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating  the system  Im saying capital punishment is murder  period.  Not because of this that and the other  but because it involves taking human life. Thats  my  definition of murder.  I make no appeals to dictionaries or to  objective  morals.Okay  so this is what you call murder.  But  the question is whether or notall such  murders  are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human lifeis wrong  no matter what the circumstances  If we  as a society  decide to murder someone  then we should say that  and lists our reasons for doing so  and live with the moral consequences.  We should not play word games and pretend that murder isnt murder.  And thats  my  opinion about how society ought to be run.But  this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that aninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And  every member ofsociety shares this blame.  And  most peoples definitions of murderinclude some sort of malicious intent  which is not involved in anexecution  is it   But  we were trying to discuss an objective moral system  or at least its  possibilty.  What ramifications does your personal system have on an  objective one  No  we were not discussing an objective moral system.  I was showing you that you didnt have one  because  for one thing  you were incapable of defining the terms in it  for example   murder .Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not  because by allowingit at all  society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who theinnocent victim is.  Were not talking about reading minds  we are just talking about knowing the  truth.  Yes  we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth  but  the court systems work on a principle of knowing the  truth   beyond a  reasonable doubt.    Sorry  but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately.  Here is what you said  \\t And  since we are looking totally objectively at this case  \\tthen we know what people are thinking when they are voting to \\texecute the person or not.  If the intent is malicious and  \\tunfair  then the execution would be murder.  What you are doing now is to slide into another claim  which is quite different.  The jury being  persuaded  beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt.Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a convictionwas moral or not.  But  in an objective system  only the absolute truthmatters  and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  Thatis  twelve members must be convinced of a truth. Moreover  a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and I would laugh at.But then  if we read the minds of these people  we would know that theconviction was unfair.  But  would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds   If we assume that  it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth  why is it so much less  fair  in your opinion  if we only have a good approximation of the absolute  truth  Its not a question of fairness.  Your claim  which I have quoted above is a claim about whether we can  know  it was fair  so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder.Yes  while we could objectively determine the difference  if we knew allpossible information   we cant always determine the difference in ourflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isnt objectively perfect.  You see  it doesnt matter ifwe  know  it is fair or not.  Objectively  it is either fair or it is not. Now theres a huge difference.  If we can read minds  we can know  and if we cannot read minds  we can know nothing.  The difference is not in degree of fairness  but in what we can know.But what we know has no effect on an objective system.  I think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system  if we are  clear on which goals it is supposed to promote. Im not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that I am pretty sure does not exist.Why are you so sure  I simply want people to confront reality.   My  reality  remember.Why is  your  reality important  In this case  the reality is that   ideal theories apart  we can never know  even after the fact  about the fairness of the justice system.  For every innocent person released from Death Row  there may have been a dozen innocent people executed  or a hundred  or none at all.  We simply dont know.But  we can assume that the system is fairly decent  at least most likely.And  you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about atotally ideal and objective system. Now what are we going to do   On the one hand  we can pretend that we have an ideal theory  and that we can know things we can never know  and the Justie System is fair  and that we can wave a  magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder  and go  on our way.Well  we can have an ideal system  but the working system can not be ideal.We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation tothe ideal system as possible. On the other hand  we can recognize that all Justice has a small   we hope   probability of punishing the innocent  and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up  and then say   Well  here we go  murdering again.   Maybe some of us will even say  Gee  I wonder if all this is strictly necessary  Yes  we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this. I think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society  instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word  games.We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keepseparating the justice system from the pack  And lest I forget  I also dont think we have an objective moral system  and I believe I only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it.I dont think our country has an objective system  but I think such anobjective system can exist  in theory.  Without omniscience  an objectivesystem is not possible in practice.keith',\n",

A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km  or about 43K mi . The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.   He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.   Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars  I dont know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items  Or is this an indication that the car was abused If it is the first set of brake pads on front  then this is fine. My careats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing themuffler too is also ok. Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon The mileage is fairly low   but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Checkthe maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valveadjustments  timing belt changes and so on.The 60k mile service is often expensive  so make sure he has done everything. The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot  but  I dont know how to verify this...  Ive seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood  though. Well  this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying acar with highway miles. Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires hehas been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets a hard driven car 6 10 sets. Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept  its currently out of warranty  a similarly priced 90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left  and I dont want to worry about paying for any repair bills...Well  the Maxima should be pretty reliable   but if its out of warrantyyou should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stufffor Japanese cars can be expensive. But  I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out  by the way 1995 model year  I believe.

Okay   let me try to explain this.  When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or   worse yet   a President  one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such   ones influence is highly diluted. I might add that   even if one were free to vote on individual regulations  the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation  combined with the very small chance of ones vote making a difference   would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations.     Im afraid that Ive lost the thread here.  I didnt suggest that all government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I dont follow the comments above.        Sorry  but it strikes me that it is the only  feasible  approach.  What is  not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and   licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent  tasks.  Im not sure what you mean by  feasible  in this case.  Do you mean that    are impossible in priciple   or merely that it would be undesirable in fact I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equallyundesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to drawsupport among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.Furthermore  I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in anindustrial society because the weight of litigation and or misery itwould produce would effectively crush productive effort.    Actually  the only areas of public spending above that strike me as   generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.   It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to  be to a principle of non coercion  the only areas of public spending  that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...   You say this as if it were surprising   yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy.  All non coersive functions should be dealt  with privately   therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones.No  Im not surprised.  I just think its interesting that on one handlibertarians assume a limited government can be decreed  yet on the otherposit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.   I realizethat many libertarians assume that such a government will be counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry  but it is worth noting thatwidespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent theestablishment of totalitarian government  e.g. Iraq.       Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries  frequently generate support by acting as protectors of  geezers     mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds  that  we dont have much to fear  from them do so at their own peril.  Much more likely its drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more  likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before.   In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm   let me say this directly  The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered  defense   an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups  is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously dispute this Yup  sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirementthat the government provide for the general welfare  Article I section 8  Im willing to justify such programs on that basis.   \\tI dont want to seem patronizing   but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons  like yourself  who make the decisions. I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.  I dont expect you to agree with me   but you explain why you feel Im wrong Well  in the first place  I dont support a  socialized economic system. I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is notthe case that  any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corruptas the buyer or seller.   There are multitudes of examples where such astatement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactionsthat provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only oneexample.jsh Mr. Grinch  Steve Hendricks                           DOMAIN   steveh thor.ISC BR.COM    One thing about data  it sure does cut   UUCP     ... uunet isc br thor steveh the bulls  t.

The only category that I see which shows an advantage for Alomar is OBP.I nominate this last bit for  Anti Stathead Quote of the Week .Alomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensivecategory  while Baerga  who studied in the Joe Carter School of Out Burning has more impressive mediot stats  largely due to opportunities ratherthan quality.The lines are fairly close in value  but edge to Alomar.Now Baerga aint chopped liver  but Alomar is still the man to beat amongAL second basemen...

Every   once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water   under the plywood carpet cover on the trunk.  I would guess this usually   happens   after a good thunder storm.  A few Qs       1  Is this a common problem    2  Where are the drain holes located for the hatch  I noticed this is my 89 probe also  when recently cleaning out the back.  I   think the water is coming  up  through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the   spare.  Mine looked slightly worn  and there was no water or water damage above   the level of the spare area.  This has taken a low priority since I just found out  while rotating my tires    that I have a torn CV boot   ugh  Ive got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is wherethe water is getting in.  When I first got it  had it for a month   one of the reartaillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replacedthe entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This timeI happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  Thedealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them tofix it.   They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the sameproblem.   I havent noticed water in the taillamps  or the trunk  for the last 2.5years  but just last month  the taillamp just fogged up again.  Im going to tryto take it back to get them to fix it again.  Im real tempted to drill some ventand drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This isgetting very annoying.  Almost every other  89 GT Ive seen has had this problem.

The Get Date call notices that a  midnight reset  flag has been set  and then then advances the date.  Anybody with more info There are two problems  1  the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit    for day increment  so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the    meantime  and 2  the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first get date    call from ANYBODY  after the wrap indicator has been set . So    unless the first BIOS get date call after midnight is done by    the DOS kernel  which is the only part of DOS which knows how to    increment the date  the day wrap indication is normally lost.My guess is that Kevins menu system uses BIOS calls to read theclock  in order to display the time   and is hence the entity whichcauses the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the menu systemnotices the day wrap  which I think is indicated by a non zerovalue in AL   there really isnt any particularly good way to tell DOSabout it  so that DOS can update the day. The menu system should useDOS calls to get the time  which would cause the DOS kernel to dothe BIOS call  and the wrap indicator would hence be processedproperly.  Possibly  though  the menu system cant easily use DOScalls for time  because DOS is not reentrant  and perhaps timeincrementing ofters occur while the menu system is inside someother DOS call.Wally Bass',\n",

Supposedly  the government rethought thissoon after  and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF oftheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space isquickly dissapated  by the square of the distance   but that whichtravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore the published data showed that when noise drowned out regularreception  the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise free.IF you find this hard to believe  then refer to the work of theman who INVENTED wireless  Tesla.

Digital immortality.The basic idea behind  digital immortality  is that computer networks   are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on themwill be around near forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be theartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps theyll be put in differentformats  perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but theyll bethere...and someone will dig them up.   If that doesnt interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critiqueand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closesand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hangas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly  life is breathed into your work...and by merit of its stimulus  it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. Spectators are welcome also  feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.

After the image is received it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated worksare also welcome.OTIS directories house two types of image files  GIF and JPG.  GIF and JPG files require  oddly enough  a GIF or JPG viewer to see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bittougher to find.  If you cant find one  but do have a GIF viewer   you can obtain a JPG to GIF conversion program which will change    JPG files to a standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files.      When you submit image files  please send me email at the same timestating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to beused  in publications or other projects  or if it is merely for peopleto view.  Also  include some biographical information on yourself  wellbe having info files on each contributing artist and their works.

Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.

If you have preferences as to whatthe images are to be named  include those as well.

Merely send a 3.5 disk to the above address  Omaha  and a SASE if you want your disk back.This is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or FTP but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBMcompatible format.  If possible  please submit image files as GIF orJPG.  If you cant...we can convert from most formats...wed just rathernot have to.At senders request  we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as theycan stand.

DISTRIBUTION The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it isnot altered in any way  save to convert from one image format toanother .  In fact  we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such.  If you could  please transport theappropriate text files along with the images.   It would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post imagesfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them soparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.Its the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much aspossible.  If you have the time  please upload a few to your favoriteBBS system....or even just post this  info file  there.

USE If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission  such as free copy of publication  orfull address credit .  You will either find this in the  .rm  file for    the image or series of images...or in the  Artists  directory under the Artists name.  If permission isnt explicitly given  then youll have to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available  emailme  ed cwis.unomaha.edu   and Ill get in contact with the artist for you  or give you their contact information. When you DO use permitted work  its always courteous to let the artistknow about it  perhaps even send them a free copy or some suchcompensation for their files.                                                                     NAMING IMAGES Please keep the names of your files in  dos  format.  That means  keepthe filename  before .jpg or .gif  to eight characters or less.  The wayI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist  plus a three orfour digit  code  for the series of images  plus the series number.Thus  Leonardo DeVincis fifth mechanical drawing would be somethinglike  \\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETCKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename willremain intact on all systems.                                                                         CREATING IMAGE FILES When creating image files  be sure to at least include your namesomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference incase theyd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title address or other information youd like people to know.                                                                       HMMM  Thats about it for now.

The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stonesare extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable  so we just waited itout.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway  if sheabsolutely wont see a doctor  I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhapsan over the counter sleeping pill.

Professors get summers off  industry employees dont.            What professor gets the summer off    The primary purpose of a professor      at a university is to publish.  Teaching is secondary.  The summer      is when professors are able to do the research required for their      papers.

Those that prefer teaching are under    no pressure to publish.        When discussing and issue  it helps that all participants use the same  definitions  although this rarely occurs on Usenet.    When I use the term  university   I think of an organization that has  a Bachelors  Masters  and PhD program.  I believe that Cal State schools  do not.  I call them colleges.  UC schools are universities.  At a univeristy  the number one goal is to publish.Cal State University system offers bachlors and masters degrees.  ThePh.D. is not offered  because of opposition from UC.  At the Cal State schools  do the professors you speak of have PhDs   AtNearly all the professors have PhDs.

Andrew Byler  writes   \\t\\t  Mike Walker       If you are using the standard formula of fully God and fully human   that Im not sure why you object to saying that Jesus was human.  I  think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic  definition of humanity.  Its a consequence of the fall.  Jesus is  human  but not a fallen human.    clh   I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God comingdown to earth to live as one of us  subject to sin and death   as one ofthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer  1979  puts it  wasthat Jesus was tempted  but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity  then Jesus  fully human   Nicea  would notbe  subject to sin   but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguishbetween  human  and  fallen human  makes Jesus less like one of us at thetime we need him most.   These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying different  things its often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously  different things  or whether they are using different terminology.  I  dont think theres any question that there is a problem with  Nestorius  and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form  without a real human nature or will is heretical.  But Id like to be  a bit wary about the Copts  Armenians  etc.  Recent discussions  suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from  orthodoxy as many had thought.  Nestorius was an extreme  representative of one of the two major schools of thought.  More  moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox  e.g. Theodore of  Mopsuestia.  My impression is that the modern monophysite groups  inherit the entire tradition  not just Nestorius version  and that  some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as  orthodox.    clh First  the Monophysites inherited none of Nestoriuss version    they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second  the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his  successful  opponents  who wrote the conventional history claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary  arguing I think correctly  that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son  uncreate     surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway  Nestoriussopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos  that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus  which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though  becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus  who preexisted her either divinely if you accept  Nestorianism  as commonly defined  or both natures intertwined a la Chalcedon.Second  I am not sure that  Nestorianism  is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all  I find it hard to believe that pre Incarnationthat Jesuss human nature was in heaven  likewise post Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature  capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane  since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted  but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert There may be differences in what we mean by  subject to sin .  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didnt see how we could callJesus fully human  because he didnt sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing  he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you  and have said elsewhere  that theres reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents  I thought hegot the better of them.However  most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance  and that Nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic   as the editor of  The Christological Controversy refers to him  in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know  narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore  he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says  To attribute alsoto  the Logos   in the name of  the incarnation  the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is  my brother either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound  because of it  to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood. Its all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have  to somedegree  a part in being born  growing up  and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that theres a certain indirectness in the Logosparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human  or we dont have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms  and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say  I find it hard to believe that pre Incarnation that Jesusshuman nature was in heaven.   I dont think thats required byorthodox doctrine.  Its the divine Logos that is eternal.  clh ',\n",

Yes  thats vague  and the only way I know off the top of my head to  defend it is to say that all humans are similarly made. Yes  that falls  into the trap of creation       No it doesnt.

Hsu     writes  Id like to share my thoughts on this topic of  arrogance of Christians  and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians  I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them  their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth   thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the truth. But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason  but it seems to me a choice.    Im sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.   Ill start with a parable.   A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse.  When he comesover  they begin talking about religion.   So you believe that you understandGod   he asks.   Yes  I do   she replies.   Then have him build you the birdhouse.   I dont think that Melinda is complaining about the basis of Christian belief.  However  there is a tendency among Christians to say   I have all the answers because God gave them to me.   This is simply not the case.  I believe that the Bible is inerrant.  However  our HUMAN interpretations ofthe Bible are necessarily in error  because we are human and imperfect.  Wehave to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith  and that because we arehuman we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.  Toclaim  as so many people do  that the existence of the Bible allows us todetermine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fullyunderstand Gods will.  This is hubris.',\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little   time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing   program.I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with  lines andpolygons are semi algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number ofpoints.  Here are a few off the cuff ideas.First  we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now  theJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane intoexactly two open  and thus non compact  regions.  Thus  the line liescompletely inside the polygon  the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly  but this will rarely happen  the line intersects the polyon.Now  the phrasing of this question says  if a line intersects a polygon   sothis is a decision problem.  One possibility  the decision model approach  isto reduce the question to some other  well known  problem Q  and then try tosolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.In recent years  many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in anew language called PostScript.   See  PostScript Language   by Adobe SystemsIncorporated  ISBN   0 201 10179 3  co. 1985 .So  given a line L and a polygon P  we can write a PostScript program thatdraws the line L and the polygon P  and then  outputs  the answer.  By output   we mean the program executes a command called  showpage   whichactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quickexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q  and thusthe original problem.There are two small problems with this approach. \\t 1  There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\treduced problem Q.  So  we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\tChoice  or equivalently  Zorns Lemma .  But the use of the Axiom of\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\t 2  More importantly  the question arises as to whether or not the\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper  or in\\tother words  will it halt \\tNow  PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\tTuring Machine might do  thus the halting problem  for PostScript  is\\tundecidable.

And it all depends on the definition that you use for  better . Yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really happened.Well  actually  most of ours is based on what really happened and yours isbased on some fantasy of how it happened. But thats OK  I understand youhave a hockey background. Stats like  plus minus  make RBI look good.  Is it Violas fault that Boston had no offense   Is it  because  of Morris that  the Blue Jays had such a strong offense   Dont tell me that Morris has this  magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs. This is the perfect example of your problem.  You are isolating Violas contribution from the rest of the teams efforts.  You can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without  Viola.  Only then can you compare.  But you cannot know how the team would have done without Viola.  Your analysis is fallacious.OK  how about a straigh answer  then. Heres a very simele question to whichIm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Pleaseanswer yes or no  Roger  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs AL only  please.For anyone else following along  it is a well known and demonstrable factthat a teams win loss record is closely related to the number of runs theteam scores and the number the team allows. Its not a definite hard and fast function  but there is definitely a correlation. In fact  as arule of thumb  if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows  it will win another game.So  for instance  if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays  we find thatthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682  of which Morris allowed 114. All otherthings being equal  if Frank Viola  with his 3.44 ERA had replaced JackMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw  plausible  since Viola threw 238for Boston   the  Red Jays  would have allowed about 15 fewer runs  orenough for 1 2 more wins. Now  that doesnt take into account that Violapitched half his innings in Fenway  which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander  than Skydome. So  um  Roger. Unless youreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runshis team scores  could you enlighten us to the fallacy in thisanalysis  Clearly  it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola wouldnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year  butthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were andevaluate Violas as better than Morris in the sense that  had Morrisperformed as Viola did  his team would have been better off.  It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world guys.This is true  but not so open that your brain falls out.

Theres a lot of evidence  it just hasnt been adequately gathered and  published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics  who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used. Snort.  Ah  there go my sinuses again.  For example  Dr. Ivker  who wrote the book  Sinus Survival   always gives  Oh  wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey  they laughed at Einstein  too   before any other treatment  a systemic anti fungal  such as Nizoral  to his  new patients IF theyve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more times  in the last two years.  Hes kept a record of the results  and for over   2000 patients found that over 90  of his patients get significant relief  of allergic sinus symptoms.  Of course  this is only the beginning for his  program. Yeah  Ill bet.  Tomorrow  the world. Listen  uncontrolled studies like this are worthless.  In my case  as I reported a few weeks ago  I was developing the classic  symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection  I agree it is a poorly   written book    e.g.  extreme sensitivity to plastics  vapors  etc. which  I never had before  started in November .  Within one week of full dosage  of Sporanox  the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared   I can  now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  Im also   greatly  improved in other areas as well. Im sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to  miracle cures.   Of course  I have allergy symptoms  etc.  I am especially allergic to  molds  yeasts  etc.  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that  if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body  and you have a  natural allergy to yeasts  that a threshold would be reached where you  would have perceptible symptoms. Yeah   it makes sense to me   so of course it should be taken seriously. Snort.  Also  yeast do produce toxins of various  sorts  and again  you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that  such toxins can cause problems in some people. Yeah   it sounds reasonable to me .  Of course  the  60 000  question is whether a person who is immune compromised  as tests showed I was  from over 5 years of antibiotics  nutritionally deficiencies because of the  stress of infections and allergies  etc.   Oh  really   _What_ tests   Immune compromised  my ass. More like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome.  can develop excessive yeast  colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since  testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to  take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately  Sporanox is relatively  safe unlike past anti fungals  still have to be careful  however  so theres  no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons. You know  its a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way.  Its ridiculously expensive  and potentially toxic. The trouble is that it isnt toxic enough  so it gets abused by quacks.  BTW  some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately  most yeast grows hyphae  too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  Youll find  a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time. The only good thing about nystatin is that its  relatively  cheap and when taken orally  non toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect  so unless it were given IV  it would be without any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve the  yeast  problem once and for all.  In summary  I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep  medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly  to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough  actually treating patients.  If anybody  doctors included  said to me to my  face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection  I cannot guarantee  their safety.  For their incompetence  ripping off their lips is justified as  far as I am concerned. Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms. Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket   Id hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this. Steve DyerDyer  youre rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. Itsoften practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment ofnon life threatening illness is done on a guess  hazarded after anecdotalevidence given by the patient. Its an educated guess  by a trained person but its still no more than a guess.Its cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with thosepeople who dont respond.There are diseases that havent been described yet and the root cause of manydiseases now described arent known.  Read a book on gastroenterologysometime if you want to see a lot of them.  After scientific methods haverun out then its the patients freedom of choice to try any experimentalmethod they choose. And its well recognized by many doctors that medicinedoesnt have all the answers.This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe its amiracle cure  maybe its valid. How do you know   You might argue with the reasoning  the conclusions. But your disparagingattack is unwarranted. Why dont you present an convincing argument for your beliefs  instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack. Jackie  ',\n",

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodgeasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire becauseof possible influences on the Weaver Harris case.The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparentlyended without further incident  as it was mentioned neitherby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns personnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting asan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearmsin his dealings with Randy Weaver.Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at anAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake  Idaho.  The twothen met again October 11  1989  note the huge separation intime  at a restaurant in Sandpoint  Idaho  to begin a weaponstransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said   He felt like he Weaver  was being prepared to do something dangerous for theWhite cause. The two later met October 24  1989 behind the restaurant andlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this secondmeeting  Fadeley was wearing a small recording device totape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H R 12 gauge shotgun with a 13 inch barrel and an overall length of19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12 gaugeshotgun with a 12.75 inch barrel and an overall length of24.5 inches  NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrellength and an overall length of 26 inches .  On tape  Weaveris reported to have said that he could perform better work oncehis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibilityof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollarsfor the two guns and promises the balance of one hundred fiftydollars when they next meet.   Note that the ATF could havesimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991  over a year later   to arrest him   This is not explained .The next meeting took place on Nov 30  1989.  Fadeley stated thathis  source  had only come up with one hundred dollars insteadof the one hundred fifty hed promised.  At this point  Weaversuspected he was dealing with an informant   I had a guy inSpokane tell me you were bad.   Fadeley managed to convinceWeaver otherwise.The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes weremade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus  each of thesemeetings must have been recorded.  However  the _Statesman_ alsoreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving VickiWeaver  Randy Weavers wife  was played to the court.  There musthave also been phone taps.These tapes were played to the court via both headphones andloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence  Weaversattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted tomake sure that the government proved its case   ...if it has acase at all...  according to the rules.Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard hiswifes voice on the tape.U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hearaccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on theWeaver Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affectthis trial is not explained.Other notes  Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerningKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they aresurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First  they weresurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound s  sustainedin the initial firefight at the Y junction.  Later  when RandyWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported thatHarris had been struck  not Weaver .  Finally  there was a reportthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aimingat Kevin Harris instead.   This is what was reported .  Criticsare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate theonly non government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver andDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe thatHarriss survival is simply due to divine intervention.Tuesday  April 20  1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. Kenneth Fadeleys testimony is scheduled to continue.

I am far less worried about  the feds  tapping my phone than high school      scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and      cordless phone calls.    Im a political dissident. Im scared shitless of the feds listening  in on my calls. My opinions are the sort that would get me   disappeared  in a slightly less free society    and who knows what  sort of society we will be in in five or ten years  I have friends who  have had their phones tapped    none of this is theoretical to me.    As for  its better than the status quo   well  first of all  you can  get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today    and they work  well. In addition  a number of groups are now working on building  software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now    and  they are all working in overdrive mode.       And yes  Id rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted  but this is at      least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...    There ARE no crypto restrictions... yet. You can use anything you want  RIGHT NOW. The point is to maintain that right.The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphonescrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally  my MP has responded tomy questions on that issue  and it appears that the UK and other  approvedcountries will get the secure A5 encryption  and  dodgy countries willget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used withA5X systems  but newer equipment will use A5 A5X clear depending on thecapabilities of the base station.The cops feds do  not  need to be able to get hold of your private key tolisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end to end  but cellphone to base station   it  has  to be this way so that cellular usersand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellularcalls  the transmission is decrypted at the base station  passed to anotherbase station and re encrypted.  The cops feds can listen to the unscrambledcall  provided  they get a warrant to tap into the cellular providersequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they canlisten without having to obtain a warrant.But  maybe the Clipper system is secure  and they really do need a warrantto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner  seeabove   they dont  have  to go down this route anyway .  I have my doubts but even if true once they have the key they will  never  again need awarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.   Well  Judge it appears he wasnt a drug dealer after all  so naturally well stoplistening in...You have every reason to be scared shitless.  Take a look at the recordsof McCarthy  Hoover  J.

For example  there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old  and that theerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years  and this has not been accounted for.       \\tThe book says that Jesus was either a liar  or he was crazy   a  modern day Koresh  or he was actually who he said he was.Or  of course   that he never existed  and the bible was a story  and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that oneup  \\tSome reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie   Wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar   People  gathered around him and kept doing it  many gathered from hearing or seeing  someone who was or had been healed.  Millions of people have  died for a lie .  This  point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined  a great many religious argumentswork in that way   but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victoryof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost  BTW. Call me a fool  but I believe he did heal people.  That is perfectly reasonable  but it is not grounds for me  or anyone to become a christian.  More to the point  it does not add weight tothe claim that Jesus was the  real thing . \\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful  in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool  logical people see  this right away.Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany   More to thepoint  did Tony mention this   One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and hismany colleagues  fools  or  illogical men  their support of Hitler was based  I presume  upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitlerwas sane....  \\tTherefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic  he must have been the  real thing.  Hmmm.... I dont think his arguments warrant the use of a  Therefore...  \\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  the psalms  Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  and Crucifixion.  I dont have my Bible with me at this moment  next time I  write I will use it.This is  unfortunately  what alot of religious discussions I have had withpeople result in   quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I thinkpeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort ofmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying topresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally  he orshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   Tonys argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believethe events described in the bible took place  but to convince someone  who thinks the bible is total fiction  that Jesus is real by quoting thebook is totally pointless.  For example  in mathematics you cannot say  a isequal to b because a is equal to b .   \\tI dont think most people understand what a Christian is.  That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars  and why there are hundreds of different versions allclaiming to be correct.  It  is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  should be a way of life  and a total sacrafice of everything for Gods  sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  same.  Hey we cant do it  God himself inspires us to turn our lives  over to him.  Thats tuff and most people dont want to do it  to be a  real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  just like weight lifting or guitar playing  drums  whatever it takes  time.  We dont rush it in one day  Christianity is your whole life.   It is not going to church once a week  or helping poor people once in  a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  time  sports  Tv  social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ourselves.  \\t  I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flamesthan here    .  I have never really understood why the emotional sentimentsof a stranger should be of interest to other people. Someone famous said that there two evils in life  polititians and churchs  onerules by fear of the living  the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed Icould probably find the exact quotation.Cheers Charles.',\n",

It wasnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with in Johns name   it was sufficient to have valid power of attorneyand be operating in good faith.  Note the overlap here between legaland religious definitions of  faith . With this cultural background  praying  in Jesus name  does notmandate a particular verbal formula  rather it requires that thepetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous fiduciary  relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of HisKingdom.  The message of  praying in Jesus name  is thus closelyaligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about Godsdelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards  both resources andresponsibilities.  This idea of praying  in Jesus name  is not onlypresent but prominent in the Lords Prayer  although the verbalforumula is absent.The act of praying the words  In Jesus Name  may be beneficial ifthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to theadvancement of Gods Kingdom.  For that reason  Im not quite readyto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.Prayers to God for other purposes  desperation  anger  thanksgiving etc.  dont seem to be in this category at all  whether uttered byChristian or non Christian  whether B.C. or A.D.  thats B.C.E. orC.E. for you P.C.    .

One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well  I saw one think that someone said about  Show me a team that used Split  fires....   Well  heres some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well  for these guys  splitfires  Now I dont know about all of this  and Im trying to catch up with somebody about it now   but Splitfires should help twins more thanSplitfires work mainly by providing a more or less unshrouded spark to thecombustion chamber. If an engines cylinder head design can benefit from this then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase  most noticeablyin lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didnt do diddly squat for my 1992 GMCpickup  4.3l V6  but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 HarleySportster 1200 and my best friends 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know whovetried them in 1340 Evo motors cant tell any performance boost over plainplugs  which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambersare pretty much the same shape  just different sizes . Two of my friends whohave shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead Id dual plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to makethe machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense  plus they lookreally cool with a spark plug on each side of each head                                                                                 Neal Howard   91 XLH 1200      DoD  686      CompuTrac  Inc  Richardson  TX \\t      doh  0000001200    355o33       neal cmptrc.lonestar.org\\t      Std disclaimer  My opinions are mine  not CompuTracs.

I never   never   thought that you    would be consciously intellectually dishonest  though.      I am not.  Can you show me anything that would lead you to think    otherwise  See the  Spreading Christianity  thread  in which he says I ignore certain statements that I specifically acknowledged andDean did not.  He called them  the Great Commission  but this is NOTdescriptive of Jesuss words in Matt. 10 15.Matt. 10 14  Jerusalem Bible translation \\t And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have\\tto say  as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust\\tfrom your feet. Matt. 10 15  \\t I tell you solemnly  on the day of Judgment it will not  \\tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with  \\tthat town. In the post to which Dean is referring above  I said    The above is a good description of Kaflowitz  who keeps harping on   shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.                                                                    The highlighted words refer to Matt 10 14 and 10 15 respectively.And Dean countered  Actually  this comment of yours is a perfect example of what anintellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are  since Ispecifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreatyto spread the word.  In fact  it is the combination of the twostatements I was addressing  and not just the one  and for you tocharacterize that as  ignoring  the instruction to spread theword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are. Of course  Matt 10 15  quoted above  makes no mention of  instructionto spread the word. All these quotes btw are from Message ID   1993Apr13.121624.3400 cbnewsj.cb.att.com  in which  at the end  he claims I did not answer a question which I answered  and which he deleted  to get the chronology right  he deleted the answer and then said I didnt answer .And I claim it correctly  because my question went  Do you  too  measurethe goodness of a post by its entertainment value  and care nota whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood  and the closest Dean came to an answer was  Peter  Peter  Peter.  Youre just so stupid  pretentious  dull and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself thatthe sport is all there is. Of course  this does NOT answer my question  which has to do with postsin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this yet he brazenly asserts otherwise  reinforcing his claim with an insult  So I now restore the answer to your questionthat you deleted.  If youre still unable to figure it out  aska nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It reallydoesnt take much sophistication to understand. On top of which  I doubt that the  answer  is at all representativeof Deans true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thusfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Deans mind throughout the 284 line post from which these quotes were taken.One wonders whether Deans mind is so warped as to find sport in allthis.He even dredges up a falsified account ofevents that transpired earlier on another thread  You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\\t\\t\\t\\t               was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of                                                            the  sins  of other individuals.                                False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for ones sins.That I made public announcements of the  sins  of others   sins   BTW  that were a matter of public record  documented inthe posts of others   is a different matter.Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral thatthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins  soI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread YOUR TURN  to let people point out MY sins to me.Dean again  You made an ass of yourselfby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah wassomehow an attempt to  paint Jews as plaster saints   therebyrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as wellas showing your dislike for people saying positive thingsabout Jews  and now you show your intellectual dishonesty byrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made  and thenclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge. Actually  what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jewwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocriteaccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so  he was caricaturingJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding  as well asimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.I went very easily on Dean for this  giving him the benefit ofthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about  plaster saints   suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.In an astonishing act of ingratitude  Dean now serves up an incrediblydistorted picture of what took place between us  and using it asthe basis of one insult after another.Peter Nyikos',\n",

For example  if it were instinctive not to murder...        Then not murdering would have no moral significance  since there    would be nothing voluntary about it.      See  there you go again  saying that a moral act is only significant   if it is  voluntary.   Why do you think this If you force me to do something  am I morally responsible for it       And anyway  humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.Well  make up your mind.    Is it to be  instinctive not to murder or not         So  only intelligent beings can be moral  even if the bahavior of other     beings mimics theirs         You are starting to get the point.  Mimicry is not necessarily the     same as the action being imitated.  A Parrot saying  Pretty Polly      isnt necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly.      You are attaching too many things to the term  moral   I think.   Lets try this   is it  good  that animals of the same species   dont kill each other.  Or  do you think this is right  Its not even correct.    Animals of the same species do killone another.      Or do you think that animals are machines  and that nothing they do   is either right nor wrong Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals  such asprimates  have the beginnings of a moral sense  since they seemto exhibit self awareness.           Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily  but      they dont.        They do.  I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly    this  but you seem to have a very short memory.      Those werent arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some    sort of mating ritual or whatnot.So what      Are you trying to say that some killing in animalshas a moral significance and some does not    Is this yournatural morality         Are you trying to say that this isnt an act of morality because     most animals arent intelligent enough to think like we do         Im saying     \\t There must be the possibility that the organism   its not     \\tjust people we are talking about   can consider alternatives.

What   do you mean by  consider    Can a small child be moral   How about   a gorilla   A dolphin   A platypus   Where is the line drawn   Does   the being need to be self aware Are you blind    What do you think that this sentence means \\t There must be the possibility that the organism   its not \\tjust people we are talking about   can consider alternatives. What would that imply       What  do  you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of   the same species from  arbitrarily  killing each other   Dont   you find the fact that they dont at all significant I find the fact that they do to be significant. jon.',\n",

We have reached our goal   A Hewlett PackardScanjet IIp was purchased this week.Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received John SorensonCarol SigelmanCarla MooreBarbara MooseJudith SchrierAgain  thank you to all who gave I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett Packard Scanners.  When initially bringing up the software  it lets you select several options   1  text   graphics  2  input source ie scanner  fax file  disk file  3  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document I would like scanned  and in what order.Once an image is scanned  you can bring up the Pop Up image verification.  The software gives you two  errors  at this point.  Blue which are words that were converted reliability  but do not match anything in the built in dictionary.  Yellow shade  which are words that Wordscan Plus doesnt think it converted correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more credit.  It is usually correct  instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. After a document is converted  you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate TIFF or PCX file format.I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993an Intel Satisfaxtion card  which stores incoming faxs in a PCX DCX format.  While most of my faxes were received in  standard  mode  200x100 dpi   the accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. Overall  a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just too small. If anyone has any specific questions  please do not hesitate to send me email.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993                                                                                             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   MMWR                                                                                                       Emerging Infectious Diseases                                                                        SOURCE  MMWR 42 14    DATE  Apr 16  1993                                 Introduction     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem  1   infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States. Since the early 1970s  the U.S. public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes  e.g.  Escherichia coli O157 H7  hepatitis C virus  human immunodeficiency virus  Legionnaires disease  Lyme disease  and toxic shock syndrome . The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control  such as cholera  malaria  and tuberculosis  TB   have increased in many areas. Furthermore  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea  malaria  pneumococcal disease  salmonellosis  shigellosis  TB  and staphylococcal infections  2 . Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons  those in institutional settings  e.g.  hospitals and child day care centers   and minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the U.S. health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  3 .      This issue of MMWR introduces a new series   Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Future articles will address these diseases  as well as surveillance  control  and prevention efforts by health care providers and public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of E. coli O157 H7 in the western United States  4 . References1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation  1  that identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain. Washington      On January 13  1993  a physician reported to the Washington Department of Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome  HUS  and an increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16 17  a case control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or postdiarrheal HUS identified with age  and neighborhood matched controls implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  matched odds ratio OR undefined  lower confidence limit 3.5 . On January 18  a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants was initiated.      As a result of publicity and case finding efforts  during January February 1993  602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case definition of culture confirmed E. coli O157 H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  Figure 1 . Of the 477 persons  52  11   had close contact with a person with confirmed E. coli O157 H7 infection during the week preceding onset of symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons  372  88   reported eating in a chain A restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant  312  92   reported eating a regular sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients  144  30   were hospitalized  30 developed HUS  and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  range  0 74 years . Idaho      Following the outbreak report from Washington  the Division of Health  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare  identified 14 persons with culture confirmed E. coli O157 H7 infection  with illness onset dates from December 11  1992  through February 16  1993  Figure 2A . Four persons were hospitalized  one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset  13  93   had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California      In late December  the San Diego County Department of Health Services was notified of a child with E. coli O157 H7 infection who subsequently died. Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with E. coli O157 H7 infections or HUS from mid November through mid January 1993. Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was reported  reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS  bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157 H7  with onset from November 15  1992  through January 31  1993.      Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition  Figure 2B . The outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen persons were hospitalized  seven developed HUS  and one child died. The median age of case patients was 10 years  range  1 58 years . A case control study of the first 25 case patients identified and age  and sex matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego  matched OR 13  95  confidence interval CI 1.7 99 . A study comparing case patients who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular sized hamburger patties  matched OR undefined  lower confidence limit 1.3 . Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada      On January 22  after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten at a local chain A restaurant  the Clark County  Las Vegas  Health District issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS  bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured  or any diarrheal illness with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157 H7  with onset from December 1  1992  through February 7  1993. Because local laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey  SMAC  medium to screen stools for E. coli O157 H7  this organism was not identified in any patient. After SMAC medium was distributed  the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of one patient 38 days after illness onset.      Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition  Figure 2C   nine were hospitalized  three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years  range  0 83 years . Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age  and sex matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during the week preceding illness onset  matched OR undefined  lower confidence limit 4.9 . A case control study using well meal companions of case patients also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A  matched OR 6.0  95  CI 0.7 49.8 . Other Investigation Findings      During the outbreak  chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular sized hamburger patties produced on November 19  1992  some of the same meat was used in  jumbo  patties produced on November 20  1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157 H7 was isolated from 11 lots of patties produced on those two dates  these lots had been distributed to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272 672  20   of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.      A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.      Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note  E. coli O157 H7 is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers  2 . This pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS  the most common cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef  although other food vehicles  including roast beef  raw milk  and apple cider  also have been implicated  3 . Preliminary data from a CDC 2 year  nationwide  multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157 H7 that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8  of all bloody stools  a higher rate than for any other pathogen.      Infection with E. coli O157 H7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993SMAC medium  and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection  4 . The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  often bloody  and abdominal cramps  fever is infrequent. Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications. Illness usually resolves after 6 8 days  but 2  7  of patients develop HUS  which is characterized by hemolytic anemia  thrombocytopenia  renal failure  and a death rate of 3  5 .      This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of E. coli O157 H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite the magnitude of this outbreak  the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  1 . Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157 H7 using SMAC agar  5 . When infections with E. coli O157 H7 are identified  they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and  if necessary  public health action to prevent further cases.      E. coli O157 H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle  and can contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157 H7 entering the meat supply. Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens  and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior  ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink  and the juices are clear. In this outbreak  undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role. The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 F  86.1 C   FDA  personal communication  1993 .      Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by E. coli O157 H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. coli O157 H7.

Long term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer  2     the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently  1 . To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products  CDCs 1991 National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement  NHIS HPDP  collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This report summarizes findings from this survey.      The 1991 NHIS HPDP supplement asked  Have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life   and  Do you use snuff now   Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview  former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43 732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates. Confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis  SUDAAN   3 .      In 1991  an estimated 5.3 million  2.9   U.S. adults were current users of smokeless tobacco  including 4.8 million  5.6   men and 533 000  0.6   women. For all categories of comparison  the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among men. For men  the prevalence of use was highest among those aged 18 24 years  Table 1   for women  the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians Alaskan Natives and whites  the prevalence among women was highest among American Indians Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993men and women below the poverty level    this difference was significant only for women  p less than 0.05   Table 1 .      Among men  the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged 18 44 years but varied considerably by age  the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group  Table 2 . Although women rarely used smokeless tobacco  the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.      An estimated 7.9 million  4.4  95  CI 4.1 4.6  adults reported being former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users  the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9   95  CI 57.7 62.1 . Among persons aged 18 24 years  the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  56.2  95  CI 49.4 63.0  than among chewing tobacco users  70.4  95  CI 64.2 76.6 . Among persons aged 45 64 years  the proportion of former users was similar for snuff  68.9  95  CI 63.1 74.7  and chewing tobacco  73.5  95  CI 68.9 78.1 .      Among current users of smokeless tobacco  22.9   95  CI 19.9 26.0  currently smoked  33.3   95  CI 30.0 36.5  formerly smoked  and 43.8   95  CI 39.9 47.7  never smoked. In comparison  among current smokers  2.6   95  CI 2.3 3.0  were current users of smokeless tobacco.      Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users  67.3  95  CI 63.2 71.4  than among chewing tobacco users  45.1  95  CI 40.6 49.6 . Reported by  Office on Smoking and Health  National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion  Div of Health Interview Statistics  National Center for Health Statistics  CDC. Editorial Note  The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males  in particular  are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players  encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction  oral cancer  and other mouth disorders  4 .      Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation. For example  targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups  and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons  5 6 .      In this report  one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS HPDP  the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous study among college students  18  of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11Volume  6  Number 10                                           April 20  1993occasionally  7 . In addition  approximately 7  of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking  8 . Health care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.      The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use  including males aged 12 24 years  to no more than 4  by the year 2000 objective 3.9  and American Indian Alaskan Native youth  to no more than 10  by the year 2000 objective 3.9a   9 . Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use  integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco control efforts  enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco  making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes  encouraging health care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow up  providing school based prevention and cessation interventions  and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school sponsored events  5 .

       "  751: 'Organization  Lunar   Planetary Laboratory  Tucson AZ.Lines  82Dear Rob  When I read Brian K.s postings  I find someone who is honestly seeking the truth.  When I read your response here  I see condescension.  When you reply to a post  reply to the post you quote.  This statement undermines any good points you might have had  it was enough to make me stop reading .Sometimes I do come across condesending  and I am sorry I come across thatway at times.  Thank you for the reproach  I really do appreciate it.  Illtry to get better.Rob  at the same time  I have also learned that some people respond to the gentleapproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K.  so far only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In bothcases of approach   my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excusefor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.Rob  sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest  the next isan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable withhis set of excuses.  I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wantsto know  he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuseswhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read theBible for himself and come to his own decisions without beingsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.From my perspective Rob  when I look at Brian Kendig  I see a manstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I see a Mack truck heading right for him  but Brian K. is faced awayfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesnt see it.   Heres is how I seethe dialog Me    Brian K  please step aside before you get run over.  BK    There is no truck. Me    Turn around at look. BK    No. Me    Look   You will be healthier if you do take a look at     the oncoming truck. BK    No. Explain to me why trucks exist. Me    Turn around or you will run over. BK    No. I wont because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday. Me    You blind fool   Why do you choose ignorance  You have nothing      to lose if you look.  But if do not look  you will certainly lose your life.       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.BK    It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.      Besides  a truck running over me will not harm me.       And by the way  I really have an open mind. So is my motivation to belittle Brian  or to love Brian the best I know how    I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if notbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all peoplefall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.I can now see the truck behind Brian.My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of thetruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step outof the way.  My fear  though   is that Brian will instead choose to glue himselfto the middle of the highway  where he will certainly get run over.  But ifhe so chooses  he so chooses  and there is nothing I can do beyond thatto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment Brian hasnt gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where hedoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me  but hishead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he issatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.   Mywife tells me the same thing at times.          I will try to do better.',\n",

While talking about expansion  he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing  McGriff hitting 50 home runs  Sheffield getting 150 rbis  and Glavine winning 25 games.  This was  of course  all in reference to what happened the  other  times that baseball has expanded  early 60s  late 60s  late 70s .  What really confused me  though  was the mention of  AL  players who would do well next year.  Specifically  Roger Clemens winning 25 games  and the likes of McGwire and Gonzalez hitting 50 home runs.  My question is   How in the hell will the Rockies Marlins help the AL   The last time I looked  there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues.  Did I miss something   Dennis Cleary dfcleary ucdavis.edu I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it  I thought he wasjust making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in theexamples from other years  he gave stats for players from both leagues evenwhen only one league expanded.So  since stats  NEVER  lie        I guess there is an effect on both leaguesbecause the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling upplayers that  normally  they would not have had there not been expansion.Make sense ',\n",

Certainly it is not by human reason. Certainly it is not by human experience.  and yet it is both    To paraphraseSartre  the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  Itis only because of Gods own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.     At the core of all well founded belief  lies belief that is unfounded.                                                         Ludwig WittgensteinAh  now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwigs fame is oftenexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements incontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico Philosphicus 21  and Philosophical Investigation  53 .  Many of Witts comments andimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique oflanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Wittsthought  ordinary language is an invaluable resource  offering a necessaryframework for the conduct of daily life.  However  though its formal featuresremain the same  its content does not and it is always capable of beingtranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened  givingus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witts ownaccount  there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason thatany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language totalking about its boundaries  where a boundary is understood not as a wall buta threshold.  vonWrightss comment that Witts  sentences have a content that often liesdeep beneath the surface of language.   On the surface  Witt talks of theinsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringingourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time  we are faced withWitts own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changesin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy  then  through moreperspicacious speech  seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that itis already functioning. Yes   The most brilliant of scientists are unable tooffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity  In hisTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasseof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. Perfect language does not exist for fallen man  therefore we must get on aboutour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.  This is why Johns Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple init conveyance of the revealation of God  yet so full of unlieing depth ofunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of  as a man thinketh  sohe is.   John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicalsof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding thatthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes  and they tooare knowable.  However  they are only knowable when He reveals them to theindividual.  There is  and we shouldnt shy from this  a mysticism toChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is theone who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of theSpirit  the Spirit of Truth  and there is the one who has the Spirit and hasthe capacity to know of the Truth  but there  is the third.  THe one who notonly has the Spirit  but that the Spirit has him  Who can know the deep thingsof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deepthings of GOd that are absolute and true.   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real  it can be experiencedand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancys Sweeties conclusion becauseif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.   I would know the words which He would answer me  and understand what He wouldsay unto me.

In order of your questions  I oppose it  I oppose it  I oppose it and Huh   Wha   Where did _that_ topic come from and whats it got to dowith the discussion at hand     When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimesagainst different classes of people  and yes  I do consider laws whichallow mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon theconvicts attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fitinto that category   the category of classes I had in mind was that ofthe standard civil rights discussion    classes based upon race  gender ethnicity  religion  sexual orientation  etc.  Having you ask aboutclasses based upon ones _profession_ rather than ones personalcharacteristics caught me off guard  and I had to think out the questionfrom scratch.What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize suchclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declaresome people to be of more worth than others  and that would be anathemato the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.Last year  when a federal crime bill was under consideration which wouldhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty pluscrimes  including the murder of various federal officers hitherto notprotected by that  aura of deterrence   critics pointed out theabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for themurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of acivilian teacher  when the latter  arguably  provided a much morevalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.This was an emotionally compelling argument  but even the proponents ofthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judgesome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their contribution to society.   I view that doctrine as being both  a personally repugnant and  b  repugnant to the Equal Protection clause ofthe 14th Amendment.Accordingly  I believe that there should be no laws which give anyprofession based class of people special protection  via the mechanismof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members ofthat class   not even police officers  federal officers or high rankingmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

In these installations  a        low powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the        direction of traffic  and a picture is taken of vehicles which the        radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.        Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low        power and the 45 degree angle  many people believe that a radar        detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit         although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such        capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo radar is in use        is limited  and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice         learn what photo radar units look like  and keep track of where they        are used  or else  dont speed.   Photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all. Speeding is a moving  violation  committed by the operator  not the owner. The owner may be a  rental agency  a dealer  a private party  or a government agency. As long as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally or unsafely  the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does. The car may even have been driven without the owners knowledge or consent.  I cant believe a mailed ticket  where the driver is not identified  would  stand up in court. This is obviously a lazy  cynical  boneheaded  fascist  way to extort revenue  and has nothing to do with public safety.    BK We had those f     g photo radar things here in Sweden a while ago.There was a lot of fuzz about them  and a lot of sabotage too  a spray canwith touch up paint can do a lot of good... .Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court caseswhere the owner of the car could prove he didnt drive it at the timeof speeding.I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car thief thathad stolen a car and made false plates. He  ofcourse  chose a license numberof a identical car  so the photo seemed correct...In conclosion  Photo radar sucks  every way you look at it   Markus ',\n",

Yes.  But this is  irrelevant .  Youre talking about averages  when we  have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our  decisions on.  Do you really have  that  much information on him   Really I dont personally  but Clay just posted it.  Yes  we do.  Unfortunately  it shows that Lopez wasnt as good an example as Nieves wouldhave been  since his last year numbers were out of line with the previousyears  which I didnt have access to .The point remains  though  knowing a guys minor league history is as goodas knowing his major league history  if you know how to read it.  Why isnt Lopez likely to hit that well   He hit that well last year  after  adjusting his stats for park and league and such   he hit better  on an  absolute scale  than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  I dont know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or  exceed their MLEs  in their rookie season    Were talking about 1993  you know.The MLE is not a  projection   its an  equivalence .  Its a  this is howwell he hit  last  year  in major league terms  rating.  So  in essence  hehas  already  reached it.  I would guess  Bob   Clay   that essentially halfof all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybemore than half  since all of these players are young and improving. If that were your purpose  maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting  acclimated  if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price that season.  Did they   Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th placeand last place  but no more. Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road. Do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant Sure  they didnt have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted thefarm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were reallyin contention.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample  but rather that he  hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager  to question whether his minor league numbers were for real  or to send him  down  until he gets warmed up .  For a stat head  Im amazed that you put any credence in spring training.  If youd read what I wrote  youd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to putany credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary  I said that Lopez hadntdone anything that even the bozos who  do  put credence in spring trainingcould interpret as  failure .  Just because I think spring training numbersare meaningless doesnt mean that Bobby Cox does  its just a case of rulingout one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.   The kid  will  improve playing at AAA      Just like Keith Mitchell did   Wait a minute.  I missed something here.  Keith Mitchell did very very well at AA  AAA  and the majors over a season then did very  very poorly for a year in AAA.     David M.

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.The day was marked by a caustic cross examination of DeputyMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  AlthoughSpence has not explicitly stated so  one angle of his stategymust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper isthe governments only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.Spence attacked Coopers credibility by pointing out discrepanciesbetween Coopers statements last September and those made in court.Cooper conceded that   You have all these things compressed intoa few seconds...Its difficult to remember what went on first. Cooper acknowledged that he carried a  9mm Colt Commando submachinegun with a silenced barrel.   I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver  Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specificplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weavers dog.When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by DegansM 16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead  Cooper could not say forsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.Spence continued by asking with how many agents  and to what extent had Cooper discussed last Augusts events  Cooper responded   Ifyoure implying that we got our story together  youre wrong counselor.   Spence continued to advance the defenses version ofthe events  Namely  that a marshal had started the shooting bykilling the Weavers dog.  Cooper disagreed.Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spencesvirulent cross examination of agent Cooper  arguing that the questionswere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained that Spence was improperly using a cross examination to advance thedefenses version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodgesustained many of the objections  however  both lawyers persisteduntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded toadmonish both attorneys.   Im not going to play games with eithercounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1  so startacting like professionals. Spence told the judge that   When all the evidence is in  well seethat ... his  agent Larry Cooper  testimony is not credible  thathe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.  Spence continued   Were going to find...that there is a very unlikelysimilarity   almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter   betweenthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses. Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howens repeatedobjections would prevent a fair trial   We cant have a fair trial if thejury believes Im some sort of charlatan  if the jury believes Imbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that Imviolating court orders. Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howensobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was  preposterous  anddenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restricthis comments when objecting.The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent GregRampton.  The prosecutions purpose was simply to introduce fiveweapons found in the cabin as evidence  However  the defense seizedon the opportunity to further address Coopers credibility.Defense attorney Ellison Matthews  Harris other attorney  questionedRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specificplans to kill the Weavers dog without being detected.  Matthews thenhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15  1992 transcript in which Ramptonhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weaponwas to kill the dog without being detected  if the dog chased them.Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that but he could not remember when.  He then stated that   I did not conductthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper  but I have had conversationswith him since the interview was conducted. Monday  April 19  1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduledis the continued cross examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.',\n",

Furthermore  the Integra willdefinately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car   Driver and Road   trackhave the GS R doing 136 to 141 mph  and it gets there fast.      So  the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration.  And the Beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage  160 117  hp torque  for the Integra vs. 180 160 for the Beretta .   You always believe those exact numbers  why dont you drive a GS R  and seefor your self  while the GS R has a low 117 torqye  its high gearing over a 8000rpm make up for the difference  still wouldnt call it a torque moster though        The biggest advantage would have to be the price.  The Integra costs  19 111  as tested Motor Trend   the GTZ costs  16 134  as tested .  The GTZ also has standard nicities and Airbag and Antilock brakes.  An airbag is not available on the Integra and lower models do not have ABS. Considering you save almost  3 000 dollars for the Beretta  and the Quad4 is a reliable engine  it doesnt make sense to get the Integra as a performance coupe  which is what people have been trying to make it out to be. Quad 4 reliable  yeah  whats your definition of reliable  if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect  not to mention  a hell of alot smoother and quieter   balance shafts.The Acura has the engine   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day  everyday and youll never blow a hose  or crack the block  or anything else.  I speakfrom expierence  Im not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine  but dont highlight reliability when youcomparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more  it is abetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  Anddoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.NOTE  this isnt a flame on the GTZ  or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berretais a nice car  and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonableprice not to mention  it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from onesource  isnt too reliable.  Read other sources  and drive both cars.  While Ihavent driven a GTZ  I have driven GTs  and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines  so they are similair. ',\n",

This will be the the first time Ive taken anyone for an extended ride    read  farther than around the block     .  Well be riding some twisty     fairly bumpy roads  the Mines Road Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans .Id say this is a very bad idea   you should start out with somethingmuch mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.That particular road requires full concentration   not the sort ofthing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.Once you both decide that you like riding together  and want to dosomething longer and more challenging   then  go for a hard core roadlike Mines Mt. Hamilton.In any case  its  your   moral  responsibility to make sure that shehas proper gear that fits   especially if youre going sportriding.  Eric',\n",

It is an S386c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing mysecond meg of DRAM for the video  and thanks to Orchid  I got a fixfrom their tech support  it was jumper settings not given in theordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered fromthem  so I guess I should be glad they didnt just say  Buy the memoryfrom us  or something like that. \\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a1024x768x32k color mode on the thing  either in full screen orenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that  given 2MBof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known  I wouldnt have bothered.  Iasked them why  and all I got was  Your point is well taken  butOrchids software developers are busy with other projects. \\tSo  to get to the point  finally  ARE there any s3 86c805drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes   Id love toget another card  but perhaps it will have to wait until the nextgeneration of cards comes out  since this card came bundled with mysystem and its not so easy to exchange these things unless theyrebroken.\\tIf you want these modes  steer away from Orchids s3 86c805cards  ie. VLB or VA VLB   at least until their developers are  lessbusy .  If the magazines are to believed  Ive only seen one s3 86c805product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color  Genoa   although evenn that might be a misprint.\\tPlease  if there are generic or semi generic drivers outthere  let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK  but Icoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.Thanks.donyee athena.mit.edu',\n",

What bothers me is when others suggest that  in these   matters of faith  their specific beliefs are not only true to them   but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this  that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth  and thus   anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing  the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see  a lack of respect for the  honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.   It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own ability to know the truth.  There are also different paths in some areas of practice.  But Id like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying  their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others.   If something is true  it is true for everyone  assuming that the belief is something about God  history  etc....Yes  I agree.  What Im trying to point out is that  in matters of faith i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive   one may be convincedof the truth of certain things through  for instance  personalrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or thosebeliefs with others.  And I dont think that its arrogant  persay  toaccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think theconflict arises is in assuming that  where disagreements on beliefsarise  all others  must  have been given the same truth  and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest  that they are rejecting something they  know  to be truth because it is inconvenient for them  or because they wish to spurn God.I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that  all  truths one holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships withGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth  just that some areasof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or revealed that truth.     comments  criticism welcome...

You must be using values to mean something different from the way I  see it used normally.    And you are certainly using Science like that if you equate it to   the real world .    Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe  and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning  those perceptions.Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreedinterpretations of our observations  perceptions .  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.  Values are ... well they are what I value.  They are what I would have rather than not have   what I would experience  rather than not  and so on.Values can also refer to meaning.  For example in computer science thevalue of 1 is TRUE  and 0 is FALSE.  Science is based on commonly agreedvalues  interpretation of observations   although science can result in areinterpretation of these values.

In their names we demand justice.In April 1915  the Turkish government began a systematically executed de population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusivelyruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The result  1.5 million murdered  30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolenand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3 000 years of Armenian civilizationon those lands. Today  the Turkish government continues to scrape clean anyvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Todays Turkishgovernmental policy is to re write the history of the era  to manufacturedistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In the face of refutation ad nauseam  the Turkish Historical Society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era  genocide is an effective state policy when it remains un redressed and un punished. A crime unpunished is a crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the successful genocide of the Armenians.Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians  yet...Armenians were removed from every city  town  and village in the whole of Turkey  Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  rebels .Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians  yet...Turkish populationfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey  the Armenian homeland.Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority  yet...Turkey claims Armenians were a  threat .In a final insult to the victims  the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of approximately 100 000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.Today  the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. Thesuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkeys Kurdishpopulation.The Armenians demand recognition  reparation  return of Armenian land andproperty lost as a result of this genocide.ARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR   David Davidian dbd urartu.sdpa.org      Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

An awful lot of thestarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economicpolicies of the Western countries  as well as by the diet of the typicalWesterner.  For instance  some third world countries with terriblemalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce    so that it canbe fed to cattle in the US  to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  Theyhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loanswe encouraged them to take out.  Fund raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarreidea  instead  we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny theyve got.Perhaps its more accurate to say that theres a Western ethic againstWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the childrenare dying in the Third World  we couldnt give a shit.  And that goes for thesupposed  Pro Life  movement  too.  They could save far more lives byfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting againstabortion.  Hell  if theyre only interested in fetuses  they could save moreof those by fighting for human rights in China.And besides  Suzannes answer implies that non Western countries lack thisethic against infanticide.  Apart from China  with its policy of mandatoryforced abortion in Tibet  I dont believe this to be the case.mathew',\n",

I specificallysaid that it was  a prime cause  of this  not  the prime cause  or  theonly cause  of this    I recognize that there are probably other factorstoo  but I think that extra marital sex and subsequent destabilizationof the family is probably a significant factor to the rise inpsychological problems  including depression  in the West in the 20thcentury.

They however  have a wrap of   10  to 15   again  this is over and above any overhead charge .    Wrong Allen. The max overhead charge is ALL of the charge. There is no  seperately budgeted overhead in any shape size form or fashion.    A professor at the University of Virginia told me their wrap was about 15 . The subcontracts I have let out and worked on for other universities are about the same. My employer  a non profit research institute  does the same. This is generally reffered to as the fee.  I dont care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY singleline item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing aswrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at Marquette  University of Wisconsin Madison  Utah State  Weber State orEmbry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instancethat I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of ourUniversity who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it didnot happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overheadto be a legitimate charge.  How do   I know  I write proposals and have won contracts and I know to the dime  what the charges are. At UAH for example the overhead is 36.6 .   Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate. Go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a project. I did they never heard of it but suggest that  like our president did  thatany percentage number like this is included in the overhead.  If you have some numbers Allen then show them else quit barking.    I did Dennis  read the article. To repeat  an internal estimate done by the Reston costing department says Freedom can be built for about  1.8B a year and operated for  1B per year  IF  all the money where spent on Freedom. Since we spend about half a billion    more per year it looks like roughly 25  of the money is wasted. Now if you think Im making this up  you can confirm it in the anonymous editorial published a few weeks ago in Space News. No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employeeof the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dontbetter or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.Kinda funny isnt it that someone who talks about a problem like this isat a place where everything is overhead. This Dennis  is why NASA has so many problems  you cant accept that anything is wrong unless you can blame it on Congress. Oh  sure  youll say NASA has problems but do you believe it  Remember the WP 02 overrun  You insisted it was all congresses fault when NASA management knew about the overrun for almost a year yet refused to act. Do you still blame Congress for the overrun  Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionallydemanded change that caused the problems  Methinks that you are being selective with the facts again.  By your own numbers Allen  at a cost of 500 million per flight the  service cost of flying shuttle to SSF is 2 billion for four flights  so how  did you get your one billion number    I have no idea what your trying to say here Dennis.     Allen    If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a costof 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your friend  at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply itfor a billion a year  if the wrap were gone . This merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.Dennis  University of Alabama in Huntsville.Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is goingto have to do Allens math for him for a while.

Its like handing out militarysecrets to the whole world in envelopes marked  dont open me.   I canimagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came toa trial.  One would be the stupidity of the governments actions. Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by cracking the system outside the USA.  The US government could probably stop importation of clone hardware  but a software implementation should be practical.Amusing thought  could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasablefor a fast software implementation  but which is easy in custom hardware In DES  the extensive use of permutation tables  trivial in hardware  youjust swap bus lines   but relatively slow in software have had a big effecton the speed difference between hardware and software implementations ofthat cipher  indeed  I suspect that Lucifers designers were well aware thatit would be  and approved.   Certain algorythms  usually parallel searchalgorythms  can be very slow in software  yet can fly in custom hardware.I have no proof of their employment in Clipper    it is pure conjecture.  However  as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs  then the inclusion of such techniques seems credible.Hmmm...

Given the enormous  power   i was just wondering   what if they are   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by    Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges    Now  in the good old days before GRO data  it was thought thegamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy  it was expected thatGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population within a few hundred light years  or that they were in the galactichalo.  Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed  also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster wasprobably in the LMC  suggesting theorists might be wrong back then... \\tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halopopulation should show anisotropy  a local disk population isruled out completely at this stage    to avoid the anisotropy youhave to push the halo out  the energy then gets large  the mechanismof getting NS out that far becomes questionable  and we should startto see for example the Andromedas bursters.\\tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution but only just    but no one can think of a plausible source withthe right spectrum. Or  it can be a cosmological distances  henceisotropy  and the edge is  the edge of the Universe     If at cosmological distances you need very high energy  to detect and a very compact source  for spectrum   ergo a neutron starcolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then gettingthe spectrum is very hard  but conceivable.\\tIf we know anything about physics at that level the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmicstrings  wrong spectrum for one thing.The situation is further complicated by recent claims thatthere are two classes of sources       in the colliding NStheyd actually probably fit relatively easily into theNS NS and NS BH collision scenarios respectively    my own pet theory is that its  Flying saucers  entering   hyperspace       but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes   i just wondered   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.If you can think of one  remember to invite me to Stockholm...

Remember  this was a suspicion of tax evasion warrant.  There were no   witnesses  except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All  they had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed  near the  building  and the press couldve done their job  and wouldve  been able to back the FBIs story with close up video  while incurring no  risk to the press.  Unless they did not want the public to see something.   The complete lack of any  other source of information other than the  FBI really causes me concern.  Sick to my stomach  and getting sicker from all the Government apologistsWell put  Jim.  I am as concerned about the medias complicity in thisgrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage  the lawsuits  theinvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away fromany other story   Particularly if a Republican administration had beenbehind it.  Whats going on here Lets look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.Im a student of human phychology  particularly in the area of psy opsbecause Ive found some of the techniques to be useful in businessnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEURknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do apsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI hadprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koreshs behavior wasemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away fromcivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve theirisolation.  It would also be typical  given Koreshs religiousorientation  for such an individual to interpret a government assault asthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to beingconsumed in the apocalypse.IMHO  the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentratedpsy ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course ofaction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publiclyappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered thetanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.They KNEW that sending tanks  oops  combat engineering vehicles obstensibly to perform  gas insertions   love that NewSpeak  WOULD pushhim over the edge.Look at some supporting evidence.  Koreshs attorney mentioned on TVearlier today  4 20  that one of Koreshs major concern was the biblicalrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI  through Renoon Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was truethey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW theywere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational andreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would  atthe first sign of preparations for suicide  have pulled completely back andwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the gas insertion  right up to the point where flames appeared.  The imagethat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting backand forth in front of the burning compound  gloating over the kill.Lets step back and assess how this thing could have been ended withoutbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agencyinterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservationof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back abandoned the assault  torn down the concertina wire and removed thearmor  maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploitedhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  Asimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tellhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could nothave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left thecompound.  Simple  clean and safe but because it would have required theFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of therevenge they sought  it was totally out of the question.

Theres a lot of evidence  it just hasnt been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used.Snort.  Ah  there go my sinuses again. For example  Dr. Ivker  who wrote the book  Sinus Survival   always gives Oh  wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey  they laughed at Einstein  too  before any other treatment  a systemic anti fungal  such as Nizoral  to his new patients IF theyve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  Hes kept a record of the results  and for over  2000 patients found that over 90  of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms.  Of course  this is only the beginning for his program.Yeah  Ill bet.  Tomorrow  the world.Listen  uncontrolled studies like this are worthless. In my case  as I reported a few weeks ago  I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection  I agree it is a poorly  written book    e.g.  extreme sensitivity to plastics  vapors  etc. which I never had before  started in November .  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox  the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared   I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  Im also  greatly  improved in other areas as well.Im sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac whoresponds to  miracle cures.  Of course  I have allergy symptoms  etc.  I am especially allergic to molds  yeasts  etc.  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body  and you have a natural allergy to yeasts  that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.Yeah   it makes sense to me   so of course it should be taken seriously.Snort. Also  yeast do produce toxins of various sorts  and again  you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.Yeah   it sounds reasonable to me . Of course  the  60 000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised  as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics  nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies  etc.  Oh  really   _What_ tests   Immune compromised  my ass.More like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome. can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately  Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals  still have to be careful  however  so theres no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.You know  its a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misusedin this way.  Its ridiculously expensive  and potentially toxic.The trouble is that it isnt toxic enough  so it gets abused by quacks. BTW  some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately  most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  Youll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.The only good thing about nystatin is that its  relatively  cheapand when taken orally  non toxic.  But oral nystatin is without anysystemic effect  so unless it were given IV  it would be withoutany effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first useIV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solvethe  yeast  problem once and for all. In summary  I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody  doctors included  said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection  I cannot guarantee their safety.  For their incompetence  ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned.Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards amelioratingyour symptoms.Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket   Id hateto think my insurance premiums are going towards this.

Theproposed groups are described below NAME  \\t comp.os.ms windows.nt.setupSTATUS   Unmoderated.PURPOSE  Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT  and about\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.NAME \\t comp.os.ms windows.nt.miscSTATUS \\t Unmoderated.PURPOSE  Miscellaneous non programming discussions about using Windows NT \\t including issues such as security  networking features  console\\t mode and Windows 3.1  Win16  compatability.RATIONALE \\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\tof operating systems  or operating environments for those who wish\\tto argue about the meaning of an  OS  .  The family ranges from\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date  Microsoft has shipped over\\t50 000 beta copies and pre release SDKs of Windows NT    the\\tactual release is slated for May June 93.\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally  it shares\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\tWindows family  its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win \\tdows 3.1  and the Win32s API subset  Win32 less threads  networking\\tand security  can be used to create 32 bit applications for\\tWindows 3.1.\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\t3.1  with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\tProgram Manager  File Manager and other applets  and generally pre \\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps  and\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\tThus  it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family \\t\\tcomp.os.ms windows.apps\\t\\tcomp.os.ms windows.programmer.tools\\t\\tcomp.os.ms windows.programmer.misc\\t\\tcomp.os.ms windows.programmer.win32\\t\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\twell as Windows 3.1 \\t\\tcomp.os.ms windows.announce\\t\\tcomp.os.ms windows.advocacy\\t\\tIn conclusion  the only clear argument for the separation of the\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\tsystems such as OS 2  Macintosh OS  Xenix and Coherent all have\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\tFurther  Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994   \\twhen the fully 32 bit  protected mode and with DOS built in next \\tgeneration Windows   Chicago   debuts next year  surely it should\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what  then  would be the jus \\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions DISCUSSION PERIOD \\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April  1992 to 18 May  1993.  VOTING \\tThe CFV  Call for Votes  will be issued around 19 May  1993  based on\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.      tom haapanen    tomh metrics.com    software metrics inc    waterloo  ont           stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull             up.  thats how the corrado makes you feel.      car  january 93  ',\n",

Verbitsky  writes  \\tActually  Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfileAnyone care to speculate on this  Ill let the rest of the net judgethis on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920  2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted  banished  and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a   specific intent to destroy  in whole or in substantial part  a    national  ethnic  racial or religious group. History shows that the x Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time   including U.S. Ambassador Bristol   denounced the x Soviet Armenian Governments policy as a massacre of the Kurds  Turks  and Tartars. The blood thirsty leaders of the x Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established beyond any doubt  that the massacres against the Muslim peopleduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policywas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x Soviet Armenian territories.The Muslims of Van  Bitlis  Mus  Erzurum and Erzincan districts andtheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.The massacres in Trabzon  Tercan  Yozgat and Adana were organized andperpetrated by the blood thirsty leaders of the x Soviet Armenian Government.The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims wereDro  Antranik  Armen Garo  Hamarosp  Daro Pastirmadjian  Keri Karakin  Haig Pajise liantz and Silikian.Source   Bristol Papers   General Correspondence  Container  32   Bristol         to Bradley Letter of September 14  1920.

Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction  they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army withdrew  a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties  they were thrown into wells  they were locked in houses and burned down  they were killed with bayonets and swords  in places selected as butchering spots  their bellies were torn open  their lungs were pulled out  and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part  of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children  such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled  everything that the people had has been taken away from them  and we found them in a destitute situation. At the present time  the people are subsisting on some food they obtained  impelled by starvation  from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area.

Tom Freebairn Who says there is no mineral rights to be given  Who says  The UN or the USGovernment  Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars  who will stop you The UN cant other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation  who willstop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you  Why cant a small company or corp or organization go an explore the greatbeyond of space  what right does earth have to say what is legal and what isnot.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church stating which was Portugals and what was Spains  and along came the Reformationand made it all null and void.. What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged  and offer yourservices as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids mars moon or whatever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..Basically find a country who wants to go into space  but cant for soem reasonor another  but who will give you a  home .. Such as Saudia Arabia orwhatever..There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN  got to them andoffer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy  but. is it..Also once you have the means to mine the moon  or whatever  then just do it.The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else  they willnot care.. If your worried about the US  do the same thing..Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have manyother things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or whatever..Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go alittle bit farther out  to do jus ta  little bit more  and to tell the crown topiss off..

It  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40s  and  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many  years ahead of the public state of the art  and can undoubtedly break  many of the systems used in practice  but for reasons of national  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.  Bamfords book  BAMFD  gives a history of the people and operations of  the NSA. The following quote from Massey  MAS88  highlights the  difference between public and private research in cryptography     ... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted  behind closed doors. Without doubt  the number of workers engaged  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10  years has there in fact been widespread open research in  cryptology. There have been  and will continue to be  conflicts  between these two research communities. Open research is common  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in  scholarly journals. But can a government agency  charged with  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break  Can  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might  undermine the effectiveness of his own governments code breakers   One might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would  force all governments to behave like Stimsons  gentlemen  but one  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in  cryptology  but rather that these conflicts  at least those of which  we are aware  have been so few and so mild.  What are the US export regulations   In a nutshell  there are two government agencies which control  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export  Administration  BXA  in the Department of Commerce  authorized by  the Export Administration Regulations  EAR . Another is the Office  of Defense Trade Controls  DTC  in the State Department  authorized  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations  ITAR . As a rule  of thumb  BXA  which works with COCOM  has less stringent  requirements  but DTC  which takes orders from NSA  wants to see  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export  what  people think about those laws  and many other complex issues which  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in  jail  if you are lucky  your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at  least heard of the ITAR.  What is TEMPEST   TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that  information can be read from computer radiation  e.g.  from a CRT  at  quite a distance and with little effort.  Needless to say  encryption doesnt do much good if the cleartext  is available this way.  What are the Beale Ciphers  and are they a hoax    Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for  corrections.   The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward  1885  goes  Thomas  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County  Virginia  leaving  three ciphers with an innkeeper  the ciphers describe the  location  contents  and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher  contents  called B2   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the  Declaration of Independence  DOI  as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure   The Beale Cypher Association  P.O. Box 975  Beaver Falls  PA 15010  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the  line   send index  in a message to netlib peregrine.com and following the directions.   There are apparently several different versions of the cipher  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet   says John King  kingj hpcc01.corp.hp.com .   Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh  KRU88  gives a long list of  problems with the story. Gillogly  GIL80  decrypted B1 with the DOI  and found some unexpected strings  including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.  Hammer  president of the Beale Cypher Association  agrees that this  string couldnt appear by chance  but feels there must be an  explanation  Gwyn  sci.crypt expert  is unimpressed with this  string.  What is the American Cryptogram Association  and how do I get in touch   The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography  with an emphasis  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with  pencil and paper or computers. Its organ   The Cryptogram includes  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in  English and other languages are simple substitution  Playfair   Vigenere  bifid  Bazeries  grille  homophonic  and cryptarithm.  Dues are  15 for one year  6 issues   more outside of North America   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent  to ACA Treasurer  18789 West Hickory St.  Mundelein  IL 60060.  Is RSA patented   Yes. The patent number is 4 405 829  filed 12 14 77  granted 9 20 83.  For further discussion of this patent  whether it should have been  granted  algorithm patents in general  and related legal and moral  issues  see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information  about the League for Programming Freedom see  FTPPF . Note that one of  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as    should RSA be patented   which often flooded sci.crypt and other  technical newsgroups  into a more appropriate forum.  What about the Voynich manuscript   nelson reed.edu  Nelson Minar  says there is a mailing list on the  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list  is   voynich request rand.org   the ftp archive is  rand.org  pub voynich  Theres all sorts of information about the manuscript itself  of  course.

This is not to say thatpeople in Illinois dont carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing likethat when there are other people around wasnt too bright of an idea.  There isnt necessarily a conflict between practicing with a concealed weapon for self defence and practicing to shoot someone.

In case this puzzles people  I would like to expandon two of her comments.In article  C5JoDH.9IG news.Hawaii.Edu  lady uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu  Lee Lady  writes   Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also   widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.   ... In the extreme case  a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all  the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave  the house.  One of the most important  and difficult  aspects of reasoningabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context scope  and importance of the various arguments and pieces ofevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break theback of a piece of research  some leave a hole that needs to befilled in  and some are trivial in their importance.  It is agrave mistake to confuse these.Past snippets from this thread     I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....   He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would   distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from   one in which it does not. ...Back to Lee Lady   These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and  sci.psychology.  According to these posters   If its not supported by  carefully designed controlled studies then its not science. These posters are making the mistake that I have previouslycriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A  carefullydesigned and controlled study  is neither always possible noralways important.   On the other hand  if someone is proposing aremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem  wehave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued  this  kindof claim to ask for a  carefully designed and controlled study to alleviate our skepticism. Rules such as  support the hypothesis by a carefully designed andcontrolled study  are too narrow to apply to  all  investigation.I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to beconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that haveoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.   Toreuse the previous example  we know that conclusions fromuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicalproblems are notoriously problematic.   Russell',\n",

The chip  once widespread  might  effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for  voice   grepping  the US phone network  or the criminal   wrong thinking patrons  thereof .First of all  the chip doesnt do that.  It runs at 16 megabits second which is far beyond what you need for voice.  Its obviously intendedfor data as well  and on high speed lines at that.Second    what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone I dont care how fancy that chip is  its not as fancy as the roomfulof analyzers at Fort Meade running the program theyll have 5 years fromnow.

I have real life experience with the Mustang    it handles like a brick  except when youre invoking oversteer  of course  something IIts hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang becauseof the suspension. personally avoid doing on the highway  and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration    but the rest of the car is not up to par.Yes. When i think Mustang  I think school bus    F16 motor. Inmy mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80 90or so. It just isnt safe  check out your local junkyard  Mustangsoutnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales injunkyards.I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on theMustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at leaststandardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0s.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didnt have to be the 911    it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive    but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe  since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second hand  but I believe the following to be true   1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.True of Northern Europe  latin countries are something else. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed thanKindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the 30s.    they are here  and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways.Yes. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have Autobahn  is the german word for freeway. Other countries havedifferent names for loose equivalents  autostrada  autoroute  motorwayetc.    speed limits that arent out of line with what we used to have in    the US    if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not    much higher than 120km h.Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasnt passed asfar as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher thanthe US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience  comapredto the US  as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The thingsyou really notice are the higher speed differentials  and the moreprofessional attitude to driving. You just never see two carsrunning parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.  I strongly suspect you wont find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph  nearly 200km h  on the Autobahn  but I could be wrong.  Some peopleYoure wrong. GTIs  go this fast. Just kind of noisy  not the idealautobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the driversfoot on the floor. How do I know    when youre not making any groundon the identical car in front of you  have no respect for their own lives.If something happens at 130 150 youre dead  but the same goes for muchover 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel muchsafer driving 130  on the autobahn than 60 80 in typical US trafficbecause most people seem to be awake. Ive never seen any driver readinga book on an autobahn  I see it all too often in the US.CraigIt just doesnt  seem  fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybodydrives that fast  no big deal. Craig    You certainly havent convinced me.   \\tOf course not.   Speeding is bad.  Speeding is illegal.   I will not speed.  I love Big Brother.   You had your mind made up  already.

There is a good deal more confusion here.   You started off with the  assertion that there was some  objective  morality  and as you admit here  you finished up with a recursive definition.   Murder is   objectively  immoral  but eactly what is murder and what is not itself requires an appeal to morality.Yes. Now you have switch targets a little  but only a little.   Now you are asking what is the  goal     What do you mean by  goal  .   Are you suggesting that there is some  objective   goal  out there somewhere  and we form our morals to achieve it Well  for example  the goal of  natural  morality is the survival andpropogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system ispresented within the Declaration of Independence  which states that weshould be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see to have a moral system  we must define the purpose of the system.  That is we shall be moral unto what end   Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.  And  I thought I had  defined murder as an intentional killing of a non murderer  against his will.  And you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an  innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not.  I fail to see what this has to do with anything.  I never claimed that our  system of morality was an objective one. I thought that was your very first claim.   That there was some kind of  objective  morality  and that an example of that was that murder is wrong.   If you dont want to claim that any more  thats fine.Well  murder violates the golen rule  which is certainly a pillar of mostevery moral system.  However  I am not assuming that our current systemand the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think thatit is a very good approximation  but we cant be perfect. And by the way  you dont seem to understand the difference between  arbitrary  and  objective .   If Keith Schneider  defines  murder to be this that and the other  thats arbitrary.   Jon Livesey may still say  Well  according to my personal system of morality  all killing of humans against their will is murder  and wrong  and what the legal definition of murder may be in the USA  Kuweit  Saudi Arabia  or the PRC may be matters not a whit to me .Well   objective  would assume a system based on clear and fundamentalconcepts  while  arbitary  implies no clear line of reasoning.keith',\n",

I   know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our   deeds  yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless    saying You fools  do you still think that just believing is enough      Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by   themselves and not by God  according to Romans that person is still   saved by there faith.my  .02   Yes and No.  I do not believe the above scenario is not possible.  Either they are believing and living  in at least some part  led by God  else they are not.  Believing  intellectually  but waiting     is not enough.   Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are so committed  nor can you judge someone else.  I guess the closest we can come to know someones situation is listening to their own statements.  This can be fallible  as is our sense of communion one with another.  But then there is the bit which says that God   preferes someone who is cold to him  i.e. doesnt know him   condemned    so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesn  t make any attempt to live by the bible. Regarding this passage  we need to remember that this is a letter to a church  at Laodicea   people who are Of the Body of Christ.  Rev.3 14 16   He talks about their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of concern makes him sick  to the point of throwing up .  Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone  not what   you do  as taught in Romans  but how can I square up in my mind the   teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being   spat out   Right  saving is by faith alone  except that faith does not come alone  if you catch the two meanings.   I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either  on fire for Him  or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made aware of our separation.  This is admonishment for His children  not eternal damnation.   Answer not a fool according to his folly  lest thou also be like unto him.

More than enough of them arent for there to be huge blip whenever capital gains taxes get raised.    I never said that  everyone  would find this advantageous.

One might findoneself  as I did in late 1986  anticipating expenses in the near termthat require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting afew weeks  and taking an extra tax hit  or selling in December withpreferential tax treatment  only a fool would choose the former.2  The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations ofwhat would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respectsbeside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_ style advice given tounsophisticated investors in late 1986 to  sell now and save ontaxes.   In case anyone missed it  there was no shortage of similaradvice late last year  in the NYTimes  e.g.   even though that advicewas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law  as in 1986  but merely on the  assumption  that Clinton would raise tax rates without capping CG taxes  contrary to the current proposal .Its nice to think that investors always behave in their optimaleconomic interest.

Denying the obvious Source  Hovannisian  Richard G.  Armenia on the Road to Independence  1918.University of California Press  Berkeley and Los Angeles   1967  p. 13. The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130 000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4 700 000  of whom 940 000  20 percent  were Armenian  1 200 000  25 percent  Georgian  and 2 220 000  45 percent  Moslem. Of the latter group  1 140 000 were Tatars. Paradoxically  barely one third of Transcaucasias Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia  where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd  the administrative center of the province  had only 44 000 Armenians as compared to 68 000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897  however  the Armenians had established a scant majority  53 percent  in the guberniia  it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent  or 670 000 of the 1 120 000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the provinces ethnic character  notwithstanding  there was  on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic  a solid block of 370 000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts  from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.    See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of  Transcaucasia .In 1920  0 percent Turk.  We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields  bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages. They are quiet now  those villages  except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead.

It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial  life support system of an imagined ethnic purity that some of us  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats   in this alien land.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empires eastern provinces massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women  children and elderly people  burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914 1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA SDPA ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s  butchering scores of innocentTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again  at a different scale  in fascist x Soviet Armenia today.A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri town of Khojali  Pop. 6000  in Karabagh  Azerbaijan  is reported to have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of theKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its sovereignty.Serdar Argic                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.

Going into the 1992 93 season  the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats  Canadians  400 Americans  100 Europeans  100    Please note that these numbers are rounded off  and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.    Heres the point  there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team  lets say  the Red Wings and the Canucks  and seeing names like  Bure   Konstantinov  and  Borshevshky . Is this North America or isnt it  Toronto  Detriot  Quebec  and Edmonton are particularly annoying  but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well. Is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians        I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about  Pavel Bure  the Russian Rocket  I will completely throw up. As it is now  every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross check Bure into the  plexiglass so hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher.  By the way   Im not a Canucks fan to begin with    .  Okay  the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians  and some Americans . It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans  who arent even better hockey players. Its all hype. This  European mystique  is sickening  but until NHL owners get over it  Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.     With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating  the problem is clearly only getting worse.And where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans   Dont saythat the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game.I mean  look at the way you play these days. Less fights and more hockey.Imho  canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the70s when the game was more brute than beauty......     Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League  and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.Oh  look   You dont like Finns either....

Ill post a couple of these a day  unless group concensus demands that I stop  or I run out of good  material.  I havent been particularly careful in the past about saving  attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson   but someone correct me if Im wrong.  This is probably the longest  of my entire collection.________________________________________________________                                  So that the                                  Prophecy be                                   Fulfilled                                                 In considering the Christian religion  and judging itaccording to its claims  it is important to look at its claims atfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see  Matthews mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages  often not evenabout the promised Messiah  and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed  we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But  for purposes of analysis  wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel        We begin  of course  at the beginning.        Mt 1.21 22      Mary  will bear a son  and you        Joseph  will name him Jesus  which means Gd is       salvation   for he will save his people from their       sins.   All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet         Isaiah 7.1 16    In the days of Ahaz  c. 750 BCE         king of Judah  Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem  capitol of Judah   but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David  i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah  were told of this  ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And  the       lord Gd said to Isaiah   go to meet with Ahaz...         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz  through prophet Isaiah        naturally  saying   Ask a sign of Gd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.   But        Ahaz said   I wont ask  I will not put the lord to a       test.   Then  Isaiah  said   Hear then  O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men  that       you must weary my god too   Therefore  the lord       himself will give you a sign   Behold  a young woman       is with child and will bear a son  and name him        Immanuel   which means   Gd is with us.    He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For  before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good  the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further  he the Hebrew word  almah    young woman   asspecifically   virgin.   But  this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin  bethulah  mother.  Inshort  it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext  and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner  a very general one  it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary virgin or not  was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus  while thought of bylater Christians to be Gd walking among men  was never called bythe name  Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus  it becomes at best a cut and paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt        After Jesuss birth in Bethlehem  Matthew tells about aquick  and elsewhere unmentioned  excursion to Egypt  as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king  Herod.        Mt 2.15   ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken         Out of Egypt I have cal led my son. What the lord really said was this.        Hosea 11.1   When Israel was a child  I loved him.        And  out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them  my people   the more they went from me  they       kept sacrificing to the Baals  and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hoseas oracle.  But  itwas indeed Israel that  once called out of Egypt  wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And  if we are to draw some kind of parallel here  we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists Gd.   Again  this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps         While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt  Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him  and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes         Mt 2.17 18    By this  that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled         A voice was heard in Ramah  wailing and loud       lamentation   Rachel weeping for her children        she refused to be consoled  because they were       no more.    The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15  referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon  of Assyria  in 722BCE.  Rachel  the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel  Ephraim and Manasseh  is said to weep for her descendants who are  nomore.   It is metaphorical  of course  since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah  not Rachel  whowas the ancestor of the Judeans  the land where Jesus andBethlehem were .  If anyone should do weeping for her  children  it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city  on the way to Ephrath   Bethlehem .        As for Herod and his infanticide  it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows  but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign  and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesuss life to enhancethe message of the churchs gospel.       Because of the whole storys similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt  it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic  yet artificial  approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The  children  the prophetspeaks of are not dead  but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  Gdcomforts the weeping Rachel  saying that the children will bereturned   he will gather them back together.  Of course  thiswould not suit Matthews purpose  as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again  the  prophecy  Matthew sets up is not eventhat  and to anyone who bothers to check it out  is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene        We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt  Joseph   wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth          Mt 2.23   ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled   He shall be called a Nazarene. First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet s  this time.  Second  we have to ask who  He  is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse there are no prophecies  period  mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse  there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges  an angel tells Samsons mother thatshe will         Judges 13.5    ...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head  for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines. This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus  or the messiah of Gd. But  it is the best that can be found.  Obviously  Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut and paste prophecies  in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases        Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.        Mt 8.17    This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah   He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases. As expected  the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have         Is 53.4   Surely he   the suffering servant   has       borne our sickness  and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah  we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel  Jehovahs chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile  in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity   an image of a chastised  yet cherished  Israel as theinstrument of the nations salvation by Gd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a  servant  going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations  and individual Jews .  Jesus as we all know  did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come  butrather something that had already happened.  While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell  he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So  while someone might want to saythat  figuratively  Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement  he has to admit that Matthews parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah       Upon healing multitudes of commoners  it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet  presumable so that he wouldnt arousethe attention of the local rulers.        Mt 12.15 21   This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.           Behold my servant whom I have chosen  my beloved        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him  and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud  nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory  and the gentiles will hope in his       name. The Isaiah passage quoted reads         Is 42.1 4   Behold my servant whom I uphold  my       chosen  in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him  and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice  or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed  or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        burn dimly  or be discouraged  bruised  until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see  Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing  never would the  light  of mankindburn dimly.  But  the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceGd there will no longer be a chosen people  but rather all willbe the children of Gd.  Also  the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic  ...the coastlands await his law.  to theChristologic   the Gentiles will hope in his name.    While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah  the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of  believing in the name.   If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus  one has onlyto read the whole chapter  Isaiah 42  and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant   a people robbed andplundered...    So  we see that when Matthews attempt at prophecy  is examined  it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights       Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.        Mt 12.40    For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights  so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur  it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went  each was24 hours long  lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a  day  was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus  according to our timescale  a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening  and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays  instead of Sundays.  It seems like a real miracle that Christians didnt forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week    Thus when days and nights are referred to together  12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus Jesus says that he will be in the grave  or in hell  or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us  Jesus was crucified on the  ninthhour   which is 3pm  Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then  Jesus left the grave   rose  before dawn of what we call Sunday  The dawn after the sabbath wasover .  What this means is that Jesus was  using our time forclarity  in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday  since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day  twonights  and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights   even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthews littlemistakes  and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgods mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction  it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter convincing.Hearing  Understanding      Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables   stories in which a deeper meaning could be found  ifyou were already one of the elect  those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem  there is no need to bother with them  since they will notaccept the  plain  message any better.  Matthew says         Mt 13.14 16   With them  the audience  indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says          You will indeed hear but never understand  and you       will indeed see  but never perceive.  Because this       peoples heart has grown dull  their ears are heavy of       hearing  and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them  her with their ears  and       understand with their heart  and turn for me to heal       them. The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works  hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE  when Israel isflourishing  right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending  and also a vision from Gd calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.        Is 6.9 13   And Gd said   Go  and say to this       people   Hear and hear  but do not understand  see and       see  but do not perceive.   Make the heart of this       people fat  make their ears heavy  and shut their       eyes  so they will not see with their eyes  or hear       with their ears  and understand with their hearts  and       turn and be healed.   Then Isaiah said   How long        lord    And he said   Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant  and houses without men  and the       land is utterly desolate  and the Gds take men far       away  and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it  it will be burned       again  like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled.  The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really Gd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophets warnings  but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomons  and Davids  seed lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah  you find that this is done to fulfil the planof Gd to use Israel as a servant  a light to the nations.   Lookat Isaiah 42.18 25  48.20  49.3      We see that Matthew has cut and pasted just a little portionof Isaiahs verse  to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that he has altered the words  to make it fit the people who didntunderstand Jesuss stories.  And  as we see  Isaiahs verses arenot prophecies  but rather commands from Gd to him  in thepresent.   Once again  Matthews prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesuss parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.        Mt 13.35   ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet   I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world. Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet  but from the Psalms.        Ps 78.2 4   I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old  things that we all have       heard and known  things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children  but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out  the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthews gospel even inserted Isaiahs name as this prophet. Apparently  later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that  onceagain  Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier  he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further  they speak of things  known  that our fathers have toldus.   Jesus deals with things  hidden since the foundation of theworld.   Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them    And still once again Matthews artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But Christians rarely look at this.  Matthews prophecies arent theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith        In Mt. 17.14 21  we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons  except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was  the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to  dispossess  the epileptic.  But  Jesus  perhaps no moreenlightened than they  is reported to have rebuked them  sayingthey didnt have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special   It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not.  Apparently  enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course  you will find no one  these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwomans arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods  including Jesus  are always shrouded inancient lore and writings  protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead  sleeping  or hiding inheaven  with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet  life goes on.       Tales of mystics  stories of miracles   all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days  Jehovah too.  But  now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we dont get to seeGod anymore.       Were too lazy  were not zealous enough  were       sinful  its just his  plan   we put too many of our       own demands on Gds appearance  if we had the right       faith  if we  were willing to meet Gd on his terms...     Yet  even the most pious of men have not seen Gd.  You  dearreader  have not seen Gd.  Not literally  you know that to betrue.  I know thats presumptuous and bold.  But  searching yourheart  you know what I mean.   All that weve seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing Gd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see Gd.  Sometimes  theysay   See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing Gd.    Thus people getlulled to sleep  satisfied with turning Gd into the everydaysights.   But  that is not seeing Gd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing Gd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good  is the compassion ofhuman hearts  the love given and taken by men and women  theforgiveness practised by Christian   Atheist alike  beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done  these arewhat we see.  But  it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.\\x0cJesus Rides onan Ass        Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking  Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.          Mt 21.5   This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet  saying        Tell the daughter of Zion   Behold  your king is       coming to you  humble  mounted on an ass  and on a       ass colt. Of course  the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo  your king comes to you  he is triumphant and       victorious  humble  and riding on an ass  on an ass        colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isnt all that much difference here  except that Zechariahonly involves one animal    an ass colt    while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus  he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthews version  we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma    We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark  only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly  andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses  he hasbungled.  Now  excluding many respectable Christians I have met  Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then  entering the Jerusalem temple  the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done         Mt 21.16   Havent you read    Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little  prophetic  things ANDsince  as we might expect  the quote is in error  which seems tofit Matthews track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew   Havent you read   for the source reads         Psalms 8.1 2   O YaHWeH our lord  how majestic is       your name in the whole world    You  whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants  you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no  perfect praise spoken of in the psalm  and what praise is there is given to Gd not his messiah king  and not Jesus.  As mentioned  it seems to bejust one more case of Matthews pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...       Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah king is to be descended.  The Jews agree   it is kingDavid.  But  then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110         The LORD said to my Lord  sit at my right hand  until       I put your enemies under your feet. Taken at face value  Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse  the Christian answer is that he agrees  but is trying tomake some hidden point  to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah king.  Its tempting to believe this  if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But  there are problems.       In Jesuss time  the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And  it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the Jews to times even better than those under Davidsrule.  Of course  the Jews listening had no good answer  and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah  such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm  an error that apparently several Jews of Jesuss time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews  often as a result of different expectations of themessiah king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists  likehis audience  who thought the messiahs advent was imminent  andwho interpreted Psalms 110  among others  as being messianic.What is the problem  then   Psalm 110 literally reads        YHVHs utterance to my lord \\t Sit at my right hand  until I make your enemies your       footstool.        YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes   Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.          You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever. The word  lord  is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But  in the Hebrew  theword is  adoni   and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means lord   a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to Gd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either  a psalm of David   or  a psalm aboutDavid.   It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet  about Davids covenant and endorsement from Gd.  If thepsalm had been written by David  it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king  descendedfrom David  was not present in Davids age.  We have extensivetales of Davids doings and sayings   none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead  in times of the exile when Gd had put his show offavour for Davids kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by Gd a rise to power  victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone though.  Here  there is not artificial prophecy alluded to  thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still  thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So  we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note though  how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees  who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity  be the target of Jesuss question.  As wemight expect  Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses   Jesus Had it TogetherAll Along...        We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo prophecy in Johns gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment  because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesuss career as told by even Matthew. But  for the moment  we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking  and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby Gd.  When constructing the history of Abraham  Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually  under the rule of king David  theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But  to do so  they expanded on thepromise  preaching about a heavenly kingdom.        John 8.56   J.C. speaking  Your father  Abraham        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham  but Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah  or anything Christian. I have tried  and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to Johns little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings  just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud  and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The PottersField       We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers  Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes         Mt 27.5 10   And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple   Judas  departed... But  the chief       priests  taking the silver  said   It isnt lawful for       us to put it in the treasury  since it is blood       money.   So they... bought a potters field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah         And they took the thirty pieces of silver  the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel  and they gave them for the potters       field  as the lord directed me. This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First  Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.        Zech. 11.12 13   ...And they weighed out my wages        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me   Cast       them to the treasury     the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all  the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah  or of Gd.  The deal with a shepherd  most likelya priest  chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before Gd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word   treasury   had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with  to the potter   precisely because this madeMatthews quote fit better.  But  this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed  treasury   which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariahs context  whereas  pottersfield  is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However  givenMatthews track record  one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course  Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judass situation  and ifas most Christians seem to be  the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity  Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However  the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite   Of course  to the average Thursday Night Bible student the  prophecy  as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those  Matthews work is convincingenough.Wine  Vinegar   Casting Lots       Then  Jesus is led away to be crucified.        Mt 27.34 35   ...they gave him vinegar to drink        mingled with gall  but when he tasted it  he would not       drink it.  And  when they had crucified him  they       divided his garments among them by casting lots  that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet         They parted my garments among them  and upon my       vesture did they cast lots. First of all  the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine  of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies  the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink   not polluted with gall.        Jn 19.28 30   Jesus... said   I thirst.   A bowl of       vinegar stood there  so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar  he said   It is finished  But  Matthew seems to be drawing on  not a passage from theprophets  but one from the Psalms.        Ps 69.20 28   I looked for pity  but there was none        and for comforters  but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food  lit. they put gall in my meat   and       for my thirst  they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment  may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course  the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the  Jesus  in thepsalm asks Gd for the damnation of the  crucifiers   whereas theJesus of the gospels says         Lk 23.34   Jesus said   Father  forgive them  the       dont know what they do  Further  Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall  a bitter substance  put into Jesuss drink  not hismeat  as the psalm stipulates.       With the  prophecy  of the vinegar faulty  we naturallyask   What of the casting of lots    This brings up the 22ndPsalm  which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesuss clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see  it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesuss clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm       This psalm is attributed to David  as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context  parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1 2   My god  my god  why have you forsaken me          Why are you so far from helping me  far from the words       of my groaning   Oh  my god  I cry by day  but you       dont answer  and by night  but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus  ratherthan king David.  Of course  the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal  he is supposed to be like  thelamb led mute before its shearers.   Indeed  Jesus doesnt do muchgroaning  even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6 8   But  I am a worm  and no man   scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads    He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him. This seems to fit Jesuss execution pretty well  with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12 13   Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16 18   Yea  dogs are round about me  a company of       evildoers encir cle me  they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them  and cast lost for my raiment.       19 21   But you  YHVH  be not far away   ...Deliver my       soul from the sword  my life from the power of the       dog   Save me from the mouth of the lion  and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull It would seem quite convincing  and Im sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words  have pierced  reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is        16   Yea  dogs are round about me  a company of       evildoers encircles me  like the lion  they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase  like the lion  and a very rare verb formwhich can mean  pierced  differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally   like the lion   kaari  which makes sense in the context  and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to  kaaru.    But  toadd the needed  yet artificial  weight to the  prophecy  this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus  its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16  the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalms true subject  king David.  As a side note  we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands  the palms  but ratherthe forearms.  This doesnt say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then  facts arent bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time  as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm  like many others  was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesuss life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see  for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists  how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been  enhanced  by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far  this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesusscrucifixion.  Johns gospel recount  written about 70 years afterthe fact  tells us at Jesuss execution         Jn 19.34 37   But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear  and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        The will look on him whom theyve pierced. Of course  this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.        Zc 12.7 10   And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day  I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem  in Judah .  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced  they will mourn  and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.Johns attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthews attempts.  Matthew  at least  usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  Johns errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters  as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.\\x0cReckoned withTransgressors        After his arrest  Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship  messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale  Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.        Mk 15.27   And with him they crucified two robbers        one on his right  one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says         He was reckoned with the transgressors. Here  Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53 about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah  for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53  and itssurrounding chapters  one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast  not a prediction of what is to come  in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah  it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the  prophecy  in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy  at least in this case  as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how  those who were crucified with Jesus  also reviled him.   15.32   This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount  St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us         Lk 23.39 43   And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed   Arent you the messiah   Save       yourself  and us  This certainly fits with Marks recount  which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said   Save yourself   and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on        But the other  criminal  rebuked  the first  saying         Dont you fear Gd  since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation   And we  indeed justly so        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But  this man has done nothing wrong. And he said         Jesus  remember me when you come in your kingdom.         And Jesus answered   Verily I say to you  today you       will be with me in paradise. Now  this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man apparently noble and of principle  doesnt seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course  Lukes recount also disagrees with Marks.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus  not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup  but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of Gd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems  as we haveseen.The End of theWorld         Mt. 24        Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories  and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings  andhis disciples ask him about this  and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples  Tell us  when will this  the temples       destruction  be  and what will be the sign of your       coming  and of the close of the age        Jesus  Take care that no one leads you astray  for       many will come in my name  saying   I am the christ.          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place  but the end is not yet.   For        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world  a       testimony to the nations  and then the end will come.             So  when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel  ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven  and all the tribes of the earth will mourn        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree  as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves  you know       that summer is near.  So also  when you see all these       things  you will know that He is near  at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you  this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But  of the day and hour  no one knows  not the       angels  not the Son  but only the Father... Therefore        you also must be ready  for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this  it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour  that itwill come  and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But  unfortunately  Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End and that they in particular should prepare for it  prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible  and said that the phrase   this generationshall not pass away...  really means  this race of people will notpass away...   Of course  the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that  the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek he didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples  atleast some of them  are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7  1 Peter 4.7  1 John 2.18  and Rev. 22.20  that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2 000 years  Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew  or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2 000years  they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars  and rumours of wars  sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be  sitting around up there  being holy  waiting forjust the right moment to spring        So  shortly after his crucifixion  Jesus of Nazareth  Joshua ben Joseph   died.   It is said that after three days  orthree days and three nights  or three periods of time  or threeeternal seconds   or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble   he was seen again  resurrected  glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasnt in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around  and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes  anyway. As has been seen  there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen  though  that this matter is quite shaky.  But  throughoutChurch history  Christians have held fast to faith  in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force  faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2 000 years  theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used  properly or improperly  to supportwars and persecution  I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.        Mt 10.34   Jesus   Dont think that I have come to       bring peace on earth.  I havent come to bring peace        but rather a sword. ',\n",

It was gruesome. I suffered a                  tremendous shock. There were about ten people there  but the             doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being          taken to Baku. There was a womans corpse there too  she had             been . . . well  there was part of a body there . . . a                  hacked off part of a womans body.

DEPOSITION OF ROMAN ALEKSANDROVICH GAMBARIAN   Born 1954   Senior Engineer   Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association   Resident at Building 17 33B  Apartment 40   Microdistrict No. 3   Sumgait  Azerbaijan What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy  an awful tragedy for us  the Armenian people  and for all of mankind. A genocide of Armenians took placeduring peacetime.And it was a great tragedy for me personally  because I lost my father inthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.On that day  February 28  we were at home. Of course we had heard that there was unrest in town  my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we didnt think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors  that theywouldnt go into peoples apartments. About five oclock we saw a large crowd near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir Street. This is right near downtown  next to the airline ticket office  our house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shieldsthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off the light. As it turns out  their signal was just the opposite  to turn on thelight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We  of course  didnt know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.Suddenly theres pounding on the door. We go to the door  all four of us there were four of us in the apartment. Father  Mother  my younger brotherAleksandr  and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East  he was a pilot.We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder  breaking it down with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani   Whats going on  Whats happened   They say   Armenians  get out of here   We dont open the door  we say   If we have to leave  well leave  well leave tomorrow.  They say   No  leave now  get out of here  Armenian dogs  get out of here   By now theyve broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as bestwe can  my father and I on one side  and my mother and brother on the other. We had prepared ourselves  we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door andwhen the door gave way  we held it for another half hour. No neighbors  nopolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side  first with an axe  and then with a crowbar.When the door gave way  they tore it off its hinges  Sasha hit one of them with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes  crowbars  pipes  and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into theroom  one of them hit my mother  too  in the left part of her face. My brotherSasha and I fought back  of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot tempered  hewas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands  and we injured several of the bandits  in the heads and in the eyes  all that went on. But they  the injured ones  fell back  and others came to take their places  therewere many of them.The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door  so as to go into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought skewers and gave them to Sasha and me  we flew at them when we saw Father bleeding  his face was covered with blood  he had been wounded in the head  and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall  drovethem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing  but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there  having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man  an imposing man of about 40  an Azerbaijani  came in. When he was coming in  Father fell down andMother flew to him  and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance  but then the mob started throwing stones throughthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani   Whats with you  woman  why are you shouting  What happened  Why are you shouting like that  She says   What do you mean  what happened  You killed somebody   My father was a musician  he played the clarinet  he played at many weddings  Armenian and Azerbaijani  he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says   The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings  he brought so much joy to people  and you killed that person.  He says   You dont need to shout  stop shouting.  And when they heard the voice of this man  the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out. We chased after them  but they ran away. That man left  too. As we were later told  downstairs one of them told the others  I dont know if it was from fright or what  told them that we had firearms  eventhough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started to massage his heart  but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to call an ambulance. The ambulance never came  although we waited for it all evening and all through the night.Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were from Khachmas. They said   We heard that a group was here at your place  you have our condolences.  They told us not to touch anything and left. Father layin the room.So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well we say  if they descend on us again well defend ourselves. Somewhere around one oclock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy  investigators. They say   Leave everything just how it is  were coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything. Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too  but no one helped us take Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one came. We called an ambulance  and nobody came. Then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and went up to the neighbors.The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles ZIL panel trucks  and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. Acrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then  in Buildings19 and 20  thats next to the airline ticket office  they started breaking into Armenian apartments  destroying property  and stealing. The Armenians werent at home  they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were some Armenians left on the fourth floor  meaning us.  Theyre up there  still up there. Lets go kill them   They broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms  threw it outside  and burned it in large fires. We were hiding one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably Father  they had thrown Father  were defiling the corpse  probably throwing it in the fire  going to burn it. I heard it  and the sound was kind of hollow  and I said   No  thats from some of the furniture.  Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow  and calmed him down.The mob left somewhere around eight oclock. They smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were alsoArmenians  they had left for another city.The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said   Are you crazy  Why are you hiding Armenians  Dont you now theyre checking all the apartments  They could kill you and them   And to us    . . . Come on  leave this apartment   We went down to the third floor  to some other neighbors. Atfirst the man didnt want to let us in  but then one of his sons asked him andhe relented. We stayed there until eleven oclock at night. We heard the soundof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the other rooms  as we found out later  all the chandeliers had been torn down. They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning  which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in ourMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were saved. Our salvation  my mothers  my brothers  and mine   was purely accidental  because  as we later found out from the neighbors  someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well  we fought  but we were onlyable to save Mother. We couldnt save Father. We inflicted many injuries on the bandits  some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We were also wounded  there was blood  and we were scratched all over  we got ourshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the troops. And if troops hadnt come to Sumgait  the slaughter would have been even greater  probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the genocide.Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city  and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us  experts. We went to pick up Fathers corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two oclock in the morning  it was already March 1  it was raining very hard and it was quite cold  and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were about six burned people in there  and the small corpse of a burned child. It was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people there  but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were beingtaken to Baku. There was a womans corpse there too  she had been . . . well  there was part of a body there . . . a hacked off part of a womans body. It was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossibleto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a man there  too  several men. You couldnt tell anything because their faces were disfigured  they were in such awful condition...Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day  my father  and the death of my father  and how we fought  and the peoples sorrow  and especially the morgue.I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power wasestablished  and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.Im particularly surprised that the mob wasnt even afraid of the troops. Theyeven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers  setting them on fire. They werent afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office  rightacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The inhabitants of some of the buildings  also Azerbaijanis  threw rocks at the soldiers from windows  balconies  even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They werent afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were at the neighbors and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office I called the police at number 3 20 02 and said that they were robbing Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department came to anyones aid. No one came to help us  either  to our home  even thoughperhaps they could have come and saved us.As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs  near the bus station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived  on which floors  they hadlists  the bandits. You can tell that the  operation  was  planned in advance.Thanks  of course  to our troops  to the countrys leadership  and to theleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us  thanks to the Russianpeople  because the majority of the troops were Russians  and the troops suffered losses  too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all Armenians  and in the name of all SumgaitArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things  worse wouldhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSRProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severestpossible punishment  because if they dont  the tragedy  the genocide  could happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is metedout for such deeds.Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest  in the mass disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught very few of them have been  I think  judging by the newspaper reports. There were around 80 people near our building alone  thats how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all.They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

Yah.  So    Damn  Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his    future.  He certainly didnt earn his last one.   HOW  many games did he blow  in the World Series   All of the ones he started  He certainly did earn it   He was a valuable member of the Blue Jay team. Not particularly  in  the World Series. During the season  he was probablymore valuable than  say  putting Olerud out there to pitch  but yeah  he was  valuable in getting them there. In the postseason  he sucked dirtycanal water through a straw. The Jays won  in spite  of Morris much morethan  because of  him.   Therefore  I would have to say Toronto easily made the best signing.  Oh  yes.  Definitely.  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens. Your definition of  better  refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning WS rings.Umm  Roger  Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster Valentine was replying to used   of WS rings as a measureof better. The concept is called  context   and you should really becomefamiliar with it someday. The facts are that Morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning club. Clemens hasnt.Unless this transaltes to  Clemens hasnt gone into Lou Gormans office witha large caliber handgun and refused to come out until hed been traded tothe Jays   Im at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it. You can go on about what Clemens has done in the  past and claim that he is  better  than Morris if you want to.  But  the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens hasnt.What on earth does this mean  Over their careers  Clemens has  won  68  ofthe games hes started  Morris 58 . Per year  Clemens has averaged nearly 17wins  Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventingthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game  Ifso  then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs 9 innings pitched. Morrisallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact  Jack Morris has never inhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens career ERA. ButI forget  in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significanceto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986  had Morris been on the Sox  itwould have been a routine groundout  right  Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally meaningless.  The object of the game is not to compile  high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important. The object of the game is to contribute to WS victories.  But this has been patiently explained to you many  many times and you are  either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.Speaking of stupid  it has been patiently  and not so patiently  explained toyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on theaccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming thata racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Yourcontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply toany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must havespent a few too many games in goal without a mask.  Dont give me that shit.  If Boston had Alomar  Olerud  Henke  and  Ward while Toronto had Rivera  Jack Clark  Jeff Reardon  things would  have looked a little different last fall.  Give credit where credit is  due.  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick. Yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit too...forget about what didnt happen and open your eyes  for once  and look out there and see what is REALLY happening.  Forget about how Morris  shouldnt  have won 21 with an ERA over 4.   When Morris pitched  last year  the Jays won.  Stop crying about it and get on with life.No one is crying  the Jays won  and as a team they certainly deserved to winat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won theWorld Series  and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan  I hope theykeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart  and elated when theytraded for Darrin Jackson. You see  unless you believe in some mystical linkbetween Morris and the offense  you can hardly help but believe that the manwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runsout  just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50 odd more innings than 1992 gave up exactly  one  earned run more than in 1992  and went 17 16.Seriously  Roger  Id really like to hear your explanation of the differencebetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher and why  Did Morris somehow  learn how to win  in the intervening ten years If so  then why did he go 18 12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over halfa run lower than 1992  Mike Jones   AIX High End Development   mjones donald.aix.kingston.ibm.comDont be humble  youre not that great.',\n",

The latest problem  I am experiencing is with my brakes.  They still stop the  car fine  but once I am stopped completely  my brake pedal  will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself.  If feels really  strange  and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of  these days.    I checked my brake fluid  and the reservoir was full  but the  fluid itself looked really dirty  like dirty oil .  I called  my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder   which will cost me a whopping  250 300.You are not alone.  My 79 Honda Accord with 110 000 miles on it started  showing the same behavior.I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  about  45.  Sure beats paying  300 to have someone else do it   If I wanted to  rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one  it would  have cost only  20 to  30 for the rebuild kit.The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  rounded off the bolt heads   I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   Wow   Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  the new part in place  add new brake fluid  and bleed the brakes.This is quite easy even for a beginner.

Sooner than you expect. Remember Cyprus     I have to say I vehemently disagree with you  I have seenToo bad. In fact  by 1942  Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro German collaborators  that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an independent state under German protection in an agreement signed by the Armenian National Council.  A copy of this agreement can be found in the Congressional Record  November 1  1945  see Document 1.  On this side of the Atlantic  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might andcringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal  the Armenian publicationin Germany  Hairenik  carried statements as follows  1  Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements  the Jews  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease  and when it  becomes necessary for a people  the Nazis  to eradicate them in an uncommon method  these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews  extracts from a letter dated December 11  1983  published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle  as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B.

Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war  on his premise   to grant them self government if  in return  the Armenians would   help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of  the anti Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

The puck clearly hit the crossbarand then came down on the line.  And the announcers  admittedly homers kept harping about how they  must have had a different view upstairs because it was obvious to them  and  I would have thought  to anyone whosaw the replay  that the puck didnt go in.  The referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay  judges  initiated contact withthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This  to me  isunheard of.

The clinic was open till 6 00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there  and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6 00 and did not want to be delayed here.  During the next few minutes  in response to my questions  with several trips to the back room  the receptionist told me \\t  the doctor was doing paperwork in the back \\t  the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going\\t  to the emergency room \\t  the doctor would not even speak to me \\t  she would not tell me the doctors name  or her own name \\t  when asked who is in charge of the clinic  she said  I dont know.

There is a limitation bug in the date roll over software inPCs that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard inputvia a DOS call rather than a BIOS call  as menus often use  otherwise the codeto update the date after midnight never gets called.

Moreover the Buddha says that we are   intrinsically good  as against Christs  we are all sinners  .I never thought of these two ideas being  against  each other.People might quibble about what  intrinsically  means but thereason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as weare. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good but great  that we can approach perfection  albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we donot realize our greatness  we sin. Peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in.Doesnt David ask in the 8th Psalm  what is man that you  God  should care for him  but you have made him just a little lower than the angels  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid Davidwas  just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliathwas  but Davids power easily defeated Goliaths.Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks whathe can do to enter the Kingdom  Jesus says follow the commandments.I always picture the smug look on his face as he says hes done thathis whole life  probably anticipating an  attaboy  from the Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task  sell everythingand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples sayhow can anyone do this if its so hard even for rich people.Jesus says anyone can do it  with Gods help.Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people  we can avoidgetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committingadultery  we can control our own desires. I realize this was not your main point  but I wonder how otherpeople see this.   ...  \\tParting Question   \\t\\tWould you have become a Christian if you had not  been indoctrinated by your parents  You probably never learned about  any other religion to make a comparative study. And therefore I claim  you are brain washed. Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make. Your point about how  hard  other religions are is a good one  just as your  Parting Question  is a tough question. I think that Muslimsworship the same God as I do  we can learn from their name  submission .Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists  etc. claim that  God  is impersonal. Is God personal or impersonal  I say yes  but if I think a littlemore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater to be a personal entity  with an individual consciousness  butyoure right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think moreI must admit that Gods personal nature is as far beyond myconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindusconception.

It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia  not for individuals  to carry handguns  grenades  and assault rifles.  The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you    they have stated that the people  is a term of art refering to an individual right  andhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.I quote    ... the people seems to have been a term of art employed in  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the  Constitution is ordained  and established by the people of the  the U.S.  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people  to keep and bear Arms .... \\t  Supreme Court of the U.S.   U.S. v. Uerdugo Uriquidez  1990 .Furthermore  in the Miller decision  they only permitted prosecutionfor possession of a sawed off shotgun because the defense had notpresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of thegovernment that such weapons have no military value    they held thatthe amendment protected the individual right to possess militaryweapons. Unfortunately  no second amendment case has successfullygotten to the court in fifty years. However  that does not change theinterpretation.Furthermore  it appears that others disagree with you as well  vis   The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history  concept   and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the  United States  as well as its interpretation by every major  commentator and court in the first half century after its ratifi   cation  indicates that what is protected is an individual right  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.      Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the     Committee on the Judiciary  United States Senate      97th Congress  Second Session   February 1982  You might rightfully ask  well then  what does that first bit aboutmilitias mean  Well   militia  in historical context basically means the whole of theadult males of the country.  Indeed  the U.S. Code still defines militia  as all armed men over the age of 17 .    The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of    the kind in common use at the time. \\t  Supreme Court of the United States   U.S. v. Miller  1939 .The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationalebehind the amendment  which was this  by depending on the people tobear arms in defense of the country  no centralization of militarypower could ever occur which would permit tyranny    in short  thegovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people  rather thanthe other way around.    No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is  as a last   resort  to protect themselves against tyranny in government.        Thomas Jefferson  Proposal Virginia Constitution  June 1776       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers  334  C. J. Boyd  Ed.  1950 .    And what country can preserve its liberties  if its rulers are not   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of   resistance    Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be   refreshed from time to time  with the blood of patriots and tyrants.        Thomas Jefferson  letter to William S. Smith  1787  in       Jefferson  On Democracy 20  S. Padover  ed.  1939 .    Before a standing army can rule  the people must be disarmed    as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword    because the whole body of the people are armed  and constitute   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be  on   any pretense  raised in the United States.

I live  in the Dallas area  and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic  here.  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to  a manual would be more fun.    Safety wise  an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be     shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here.

Of course Dalls rush hours are nothing  from what i hear..if i lived in LA  i mightbe of a different persuasion.  And  just for the record  rarely do you shiftgears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th isgood up through around 80 90  most of the time  so you can just wind it out..its not going to hurt anything  and keeps it in the powerband anyway..only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th fairly rare unless you drive a ferrari or some such  id bet  or when you hit cruising speed where you feel comfortable or when my mother is sitting in the passanger seat complaining about how you wind her  poor little engine  waytoo hi    Just my HOs..DREW',\n",

I consider   them to be like anyone else  sinners we all are. I dont know  I dont care about ethnical rights and wrongs myself  but its evident that Christians consider Jews no longer to be the  sole selected group of Gods people    while Jews consider this to be the case.Christian anti Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews shouldknow the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else  yet they did notconvert to Christianity en mass  thus rejecting  Christian Love.  No wonder this caused anti Semitism. One might even wonder that if Christianity didnt do this separation  would anti Semitism have even started I dont see why not. Where are the rest of the tribal people  Whathappened to the tribes of the Americas  Culture is seen as different andundesirable in the West  particular in the US with its failed  meltingpot concept.  Most tribes have been hunted to extinction  the Hebrewtribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic.

I said to you  NO  MR.Davidian  there exactly existed such a quote...  I even gave the call number  page numbers..you couldt reject it.   And now  you are lying again and talking about  modified re published book  without any proof  how  when  where  by whom  etc.. ..  by the way  how is it possible to re publish the book in 1923 if it was  first published in 1924 your claim .I am sure that you have some pretty   well suited theories  as usual   And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidians lies...I also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use  which are                    949.6 R 198     and the page numbers to verify the quotes 218 and 215                       It is not possible that     s text has 287 pages  mine has 353  and yours has 377   Now  are you claiming that there cant be such a reference by saying  it is not possible...  ..If not  what is your point   Differences in the number of pages  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argics was in 1934.. No need to use the same book size and the same letter  charachter in both publications etc  etc.. does it give you an idea    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published..  And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed  tortured etc by Armenians..and those quotes given  by Serdar Argic exist    It was the issue  wasnt it     you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway    You name all these tortures and murders  by Armenians  as a  crap ..

Since you have referred to the Messiah  I assume you are referring          to the New Testament.  Please detail your complaints or e mail if          you dont want to post.  First century Greek is well known and          well understood.  Have you considered Josephus  the Jewish Historian           who also wrote of Jesus   In addition  the four gospel accounts          are very much in harmony.     Bill  I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who  in the course of his or her research  is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists  who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards  and others .   Why an insert   Read it   I have  a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context  and Josephus  a superb writer  had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has  nothing  to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is  there are  two  references toJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_  one of which has unquestionably at leastbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote  in the third century  thatJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah  while the long passagesays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of theJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung hofor Jesus and may be authentic.   There is no question that Origen  in the third century  saw a referenceto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ whichlack the references.It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted  butI dont think its very likely  nor do I think there is a consensus inthe scholarly community that this is the case.  I know G.A. Wells takesthis position  but thats because he takes the very small minority viewthat Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German  not ofbiblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant tothe historicity of Jesus.

       "  984: 'Organization  Tektronix  Inc.  Wilsonville   OR.Lines  180Mr DeCenso  in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrasesthose scholars opinion on the subject   ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records  his death.  Although its possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging  and hit some rocks  thereby bursting open  I can no longer assume that to be  the case.  Therefore  no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                                                                result of the hanging  did he   Most scholars believe he iprobably did  but..                                                                                     I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars explanations  but  in looking at the texts initially  we cant assume Judas died.  It is    however  highly probable.                         and   Also  there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply  means  hang oneself .Actually  if you do further research as to the Greek word  apacgw   you willfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellentreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out  Irecently checked several Lexicons \\t Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Louw and Nida\\t Robinsons Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament \\t Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Grimm\\t Word study Concordance   Tynsdale\\t A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\t early Christian Writings   Bauer Arndt Gingrich\\t The New Analytical Greek Lexicon   PerschbacherA couple simply stated  hanged oneself   and a couple were more explicit and stated that  apacgw  means specifically  kill yourself by hanging.  Acouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for  apacgw  is strangle  throttle or choke   which pretty much invalidates the guy whosuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down .  One of the bestreferences though   Robinsons Greek and English Lexicon of the NewTestament   not only stated the translation  it gave both the root words  theliteral translation  related greek words which use the same roots  and alsoother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature  to givefurther context .  The word  apagchw  has two root words   gchw  is the  to strangle  root  andthe root word  apo  means literally  away.  This root words is included inwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place  eg  thegreek word  apagello  means to send a message .   Apo  can also denote achange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinsonspecifically makes comparison to the word  apokteiuo   which means  to kill. In literal meaning the word  apacgw  means  to throttle  strangle to put outof the way   and implicitly denotes a change in life state  ie  away fromlife  to death .  So while the word  apacgw  does mean  to hang   itspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when hestate that it means  to hang oneself  to end ones life by hanging.  He thennotes the the use of  apacgw  in Homers Odessy 19 230 to denote context.  Hepresents that example of  apacgw  as being used to explicitly mean  suicide byhanging.  Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling  without theadded denotation of  death   and as you insist that the Bible was written byGod  and every word is precicely correct  you are stuck with the completemeaning of  apacgw   ie  Since the word  apacgw  was used  then death isdenoted as the result . By the way  I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of  apacgw    In the Septuagint  the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus    its only used in 2 Samuel 17 23    Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice   was not followed  he saddled a donkey  and arose and went home to his house   to his city. Then he put his household in order  and hanged himself  and   died  and he was buried in his fathers tomb.                                    Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel  hanged himself   Gr. Sept.   APAGCHO   but it explicitly adds   and died .  Here we have no doubt of the  result.  In Matthew  we are not explicitly told Judas died.Note Mr DeCenso  as you say  the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew toGreek  and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew  ie  the theHebrew say  and died    and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. It should also be pointed out that  regardless of the added  and died   thecorrect translation would still be  apacgw   as the man did indeed die fromstrangulation  redundant  but correct .  Further  we have evidence that theSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited  which included versionswhich contradicted each other   and such editing was not even necessarilyexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as itnow stands  as a paragon of ancient greek.  So  what you really need to proveyour point Mr DeCenso  is an example  in ancient greek  of someone committing apacgw  and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthlessassertions without corresponding evidence. Now I would note Mr DeCenso  that everytime I go out of my way to research itone of your apparently contrived exegisis  I pretty much find it false.  Thus I think that if you are going to add to the text  something over and abovewhat the source clearly says  then you had better have an explicit Greek orhistorical source to justify it. By the way  as to Mr Roses statement about trees around the Potters Field   There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old  or thatthere are 2000 year old stumps there  or has a 2 thousand year old descriptionof the area which mentions such trees  then it is inappropriate for him toassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees twothousand years ago  after all  things change . Now as to your other argument  ie  that the money Judas used is not the sameas the 30 silvers   As to your second question Mr DeCenso  you ask how we could be sure that the  money with which Judas purchased the land  was indeed for the betrayal  rather  than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts  where it specifically  mention  the reward of iniquity   Acts 1 18   it also specifically mentions  what act of iniquity they were talking about  ie  Acts 1 16  ...concerning  Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.  .  Now I would point out  that when the Bible describes an act of  iniquity   and then immediately  discusses   the  reward of iniquity   it would be rather inane to suggest that  it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.        Notice that in verse 16  the word  iniquity  is not used.  Rather  it states  that Judas  became a guide to those who arrested Jesus .  But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17   for he was numbered with us and  obtained a part in this ministry.   What part did Judas play in their ministry                  True  Peter  or the author of Acts  does not specifically call Judas betrayal an iniquity   but for that matter  neither does John specifically call Judasactions  an iniquity  either.  Further John 13 29 did not say that Judas tookthe money box  but rather said      Some thought that because  Judas had the money box  Jesus was telling     him  Buy what we need for the feast   or that he should give something     to the poor  So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out  and     it was night. Note that it is said that Judas left  it does not say that he took the moneybox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choosethe a an unproven iniquity  mentioned by another author  in a differentbook  written at a different time  over the iniquity explicitly mentioned bythe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. Of course this particular argument becomes moot  since we have have seenevidence that  apacgw  means suicide.  You see  since Judas hanging wassuccessful  he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13 29  becauseMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day  ie Passover   and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himselfthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the  Field of Blood  would have tohave been the 30 pieces of silver  Of course he got the 30 pieces of silverthat night as well  and thus couldnt have spent that either.  Oh dear  Ibelieve that the house of cards is comming down . Maybe we should at this point  discuss now whether Jesus was crucified onFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.By the way  as to where the prophesy of the Potters field came from  ie  themention of it in Matthew   you say   Please  when we are done with this study on his death  remind me to discuss  this with you.I am reminding you now to discuss it now. Its all part of the same verse weare discussing  and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues. \\t\\t\\t\\tLater \\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume  Philosopher\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding    PS. I would note again  that you are not stating that that Bible    is not possibly inerrant  you are stating that it  IS  inerrant.    Since you have been  by your own admission  presenting merely  possible     reconciliations  I of course dont rate them that highly   then the     best you can do is say that the Bible is  possibly  inerrant  not that     it  is  inerrant.',\n",

At the moment I am formlulating information on discipline within the Christian home.  Please  if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me your response to the following questionaire.  All responses will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare stats.     Im posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e mailaccess.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be morerelevant than I  who have none  yet . 1.  Ages   sexes of children     13 year old  13YO  twins  10YO boy  6.5YO boy  2YO girl 2.  Do you spank your kids      I dont call it spanking  but they do  so yes  very rarely. 3.  If so how often      I dont call it spanking because its more of a reaction to somethingvery dangerous  such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or runninginto the road.  Maybe 3 4 times for each except for the 2YO girl  who hasnot been spanked yet.     They call it that because it  does  hurt their feelings  and of courseI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know theyre still loved. 4.  Do you use an implement to spank with      No  that would be too painful.  If its too traumatic they never recallwhy they were punished.  Besides  it must be immediate  and taking the timeto go get a toolmeans youre not doing it right away  and that lessens theimpact.  Its very emotional for a child as it is   which is evidenced by thefact that a little slap on the rear   which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds  is called a spanking.  5. If you do not spank  what method of discipline do you use      Lots of logical consequences   for instance  when 4YO Matthew dareda good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out  I madesure they didnt play together for 5 days so hed know that would make himlose friends very quickly.  Hes never done anything like that since.     We also use time out in their rooms   I use a timer so they dont keeparguing with me over leaving  since its hard to argue with a macine.I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout wont be over until theycalm down if theyre too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when theyrereally young. 6.  Your age      40 7.  Your location     Bath  Ohio.  Its right outside of Akron  in the northeast part of Ohio. 8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal offence      No  and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this toteach all parents that physical punishment isnt always required   parents usethat as an excuse to hit too hard. 9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid     Lots of timeouts  same as I use.  Our family and my husbands have neverused spankings.  In fact  my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids  and theywere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And none of us has ever been afoul of the law   man made or Gods law.     Jesus says  referring to a small child whom he is holding  that  whatye do to the least of these  ye do also to me.   The Bible also says in allthings to be kind  and merciful  and especially loving.  Colossians 3 12 15. There is no room for selfish anger  which Ill admit Ive been tempted withat times.  When Ive felt like spanking hard in anger  maybe the kid deserveda little slap on the rear  but what I would have given would have been thedevils work.  I could feel the temptation  and just angrily ordered the kidto his her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking Godsforgiveness  I was much calmer  and did not feel like spanking  but felt thatwhat I had done was enough punishment.
