Burden of Proof,"Organization  Case Western Reserve UniversityLines  41NNTP Posting Host  b64635.student.cwru.eduIn article  1993Apr21.182030.888 batman.bmd.trw.com  jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com writes  Actually  both are positive arguments.    Positive  may not be the best description here due to possible misunderstanding  but its the term you used.   Positive arguments assertions can be both affirmative  i.e. God  exists  and negative  i.e. God does not exist .  Both carry an equal  burden of proof because they are both asserting that a certain idea is true.  The default condition  in the absence of a preponderance of evidence either way  is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable. And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that he she simply disbelieves that the proposition is true  is the only one who holds no burden of proof.  This is why the so called  weak atheist  position is virtually unassailable    not because it stands on a firm foundation of logical argument  but because its proponents simply disbelieve in the existence of God s  and therefore they hold no burden of proof.  When you dont assert anything  you dont have to prove anything.  Thats where weak atheism draws its strength.  But its strength is also its Achilles heel.  Without assertions axioms  one has no foundation upon which to build.  As a philosophy  its virtually worthless.  IMO  of course.	So  if I were to assert that there are no thousand year old invisible pink unicorns  residing in my walls  I need to support this with evidence  I think the _lack_ of evidence shall suffice.

decoupling caps   onboard,"Organization  University of California  Santa CruzLines  38Reply To  karplus ce.ucsc.edu  Kevin Karplus NNTP Posting Host  ararat.ucsc.eduIve used on chip capacitors to reduce ground bounce noise on a smallsystolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines. Design was in 2 micron n well cmos  using the MOSIS scalable design rules. Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors 1  They dont help much with simultaneous output switching  there is	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the	load capacitor  on both the signal line and the ground	return   so you still get ground and power line bounce. 2  They do help a lot with on chip loads  as I had with the high load	on the clock lines. 3  The transients you are trying to suppress are really high	frequency  so forget about large areas of poly thin oxide diff	capacitors  since the RC time constant is too large.	What I did is to make a metal2  metal  poly  diff sandwich 	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer  allowing frequent	diff metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly	lines were.  If I were doing this design again  Id probably	omit the diff altogether  and use a solid poly sheet instead 	using just m2  m1  and poly  and substrate  but that has such a high	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds .4  You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings  especially for	output signalling   than spending chip area on capacitors.	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for	a MOSIS tiny chip  and the next size up was twice as big as I	needed.

History question,Organization  NASA Langley Research Center and Reptile FarmLines  16NNTP Posting Host  grissom.larc.nasa.govIn article  2775 snap  paj uk.co.gec mrc  Paul Johnson  writes   I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification. Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo fi  but much louder than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out pretty quickly though.This was the Pathe you are thinking of  although there were other imitators.It didnt wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs  butit did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.There are a lot of them still operating  and they are pretty ingenious.There was a pneumatic amplifier designed by Alexander Graham Bell  as well but I dont know if it was ever constructed.  scott

No reasonable alternative exists.The big bang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point oforigin. There was _no_ time for a prior cause to occur in.

Why should I prefer to believe in a God that_just_ exists  as opposed to a singularity that _just happened_  or giant puce subspace iguanas  that fling universes off their tongueslike gobs of spit  As far as I can tell  the very laws of nature demand a  why .  That isnt true of something outside of nature  i.e.   super natural .

This is exactly what it has become    a far cry from  its original position of stature .Lets see  if Alexander destroyed Tyre  and people move back  andthey construct houses  and after a while 14000 people live thereand still call it Tyre  it is not considered to be rebuilt. Insteadits considered to be just some people that got together for fishing and they needed houses place.  So far Ive seen stated figurers ranging from 15 000 to 22 000.  Lets assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards  we are talking about a one horse town.Sigh  I was never born in a city then  my home town has 10.000people .

In fact  I think team performance isgenerally irrelevant  as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.Am I wrong And he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels staffis still very weak  their everyday lineup is doing quite well  thankyou.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments.Easley appears fine  but even if hes not Flora is ready to come up.Between Gonzales and Gruber theyll manage the hot corner.  Poloniaand Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.Personally  I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a winning team.  	The Beastmaster   Im skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this year  and how many players play until they are 40   Not too many  and most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 32.

Divide this number by 5 to take into account of the fact that there   are 5 players on the ice and each is 1 5 responsible for the team    .      3.  A players adjusted     is  His raw         Team Adjustment .      BTW  If anyone could calculate and post adjusted     ratings it would be   greatly appreciated.  I might find the time to do so  but dont count on   it.  I have a database filter set up for the player stats.  When it is posted for the end of season Ill repost the team averages.  You dont need to go through the complicated team adjustment you are using   all you need is the team average by summing all the individual players     and divide by the total number of players on the team.  This will be a little distorted because the players who have been traded recently will have come with     scores based on their original teams.  This shouldnt distort it too bad though.  If you want to look at individual players from this perspective then go ahead   youll require the original player stats though.Question If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total    by 40   If so  a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equallyvaluable as a player who plays in all of them. Another way of looking at the same thing is to compare the deviation from the mean for the team of the player to the standard deviation for the team. Ill post both.Since the standard deviation for each team is different  I am unsure how  transferable  between teams that these stats are.  Shouldnt the averagestandard deviation in the league be used I am interested in seeing each method.But I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.Gregmeister

Why does Apple give us a confusing message ,Organization  The University of British ColumbiaLines  22NNTP Posting Host  swiss.ucs.ubc.caIn  C5nGII.BGx news2.cis.umn.edu  bunt0003 student.tc.umn.edu  MonthianBuntan 1  writes   Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding fpu   In all Mac price lists Ive seen  every C650 as the message  fpu  optional .  I know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4 80 configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list  Perhaps the reason is simple  maybe the marketing people who put togetherthe brochures and price lists werent clear on the FPU issue. Afterall  Apples literature is not always 100  correct. A funny one Inoticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CDcapability refer to the  auto inkjet  feature. This should have read  autoinject  feature  as it does on some other correct brochures Ive seen fromApple . Since it was correct on some older brochures  I can only guessthat someone edited the copy  saw  inject  and thought it was a typo andchanged it to the more familiar word  inkjet .Hmmm  what would that be  A printer built into the CD player  A way of writing  information to a CD

S414  Brady bill  loopholes ,Keywords  brady handguns s414 hr1025 hr277 instant check waiting periodLines  74Nntp Posting Host  skndiv.dseg.ti.comReply To  pyron skndiv.dseg.ti.comOrganization  TI DSEG VAX SupportDistribution  naIn article  shepardC5p2y6.GC1 netcom.com   shepard netcom.com  Mark Shepard  writes  Hi. Ive just finished reading S414  and have several questions about the Brady bills  S414 and HR1025 .Good   1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill       What is the status of these bills   Ive heard theyre  in committee .      How close is that to being made law Not very.  Thanks to the filibuster in the Senate  things are backing up.  TheHouse judiciary  is going to start looking at our friends from the ATF  so thatbill will be held up a little  too.  NOTE  Things can change quickly.  2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed   3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes    A. S414 doesnt specify an  appeals  process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period  other than a civil lawsuit      S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established       but not before .I thought there was a correction process in both bills for both parts.   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying approving      using existing records  so who would I sue in  A  above to have an      inaccurate record corrected  Very correct.   C. S414 includes an exception to waiting period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law Enforcement Officer  CLEO  of an      immediate threat to his or her life  or life of a household member.      But S414 doesnt say exactly what is considered a  threat   nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement.Welcome to the world of  the privileged . True   Have I misunderstood   Any other holes How about no compulsion to allow purchase if there is no evidence against   4. With just S414  whats to stop a person with a  clean  record from    buying guns  grinding off the serial numbers  and selling them to crooks     At minimum  what additional laws are needed to prevent this It is already illegal to do this.     Seems at min. a  gun counting  scheme would be needed     e.g.   John Doe owns N guns  .  So  if S414 passes  I wouldnt be surprised    to see legislation for stricter  harder to forge I.D.s plus national gun    registration  justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.This is the  health  card.  Or so some  paranoids  claim.  I say that justbecause youre paranoid doesnt mean theyre not out to get you.       1 2  Please comment.  Im mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation  I dont mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any all waiting period bills ever proposed.

Even worse  the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this orbiting billboard.  Considering the caliber of people running this city   theres no telling what were going to have leering down at us from orbit.I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place anobject at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbitalvelocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth you need a delta v of 2.5 km s.  Assuming that rockets with specificimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce  a rocket with a dryweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel oxidizer.A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand orbirdshot  depending on the nature of the structure  would bethe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well withinthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.It sounds like a good Science Fair project  Reductionof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics.Or  it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussedhere   1 billion for the first person to spend 1 yearon the moon   1 million for the first erradication ofan orbital eyesore CCD burner.  I wouldpledge  1000for the first person to bring it down  and I am surethere are at least 999 other astronomers  nature lovers or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.Of course  a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler. Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply  the useof a large caliber gun  or the solution which was appliedto Gerald Bull  the use of a small caliber gun.    		David M.

Presidents Remarks at Town Hall Meeting,"Lines  25Organization  University of Tennessee Division of Continuing EducationIn article  1qia48INNgta life.ai.mit.edu  Clinton HQ Campaign92.Org  Clinton Gore 92  writes  	      	      	     SECRETARY RILEY   Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April. 	      	     You know  today is April 13th.  In 1743  Thomas  Jefferson was born  250 years ago.

The critical factor here is whether the sexual activity is  forced    or whether it is an activity that is consensually agreed upon and   freely engaged in by the people involved.  When a child is  forced  there is often  damage   on the other hand  	Wholeheartedly agree here.   consensual  relationships are often found to be  positive experiences    for all concerned. 	Why do I find this hard to believe  	Care to convince us Carlos    Why not check out some of the scientific research that has beendone in this area and convince yourself.

About this Center for Policy Research   ,Organization  Case Western Reserve University  Cleveland  Ohio  USA Lines  20NNTP Posting Host  thor.ins.cwru.edu   I have read numerous posts over a period of several months  bythis anti Israel fanatic  hiding in the shadow of the respectablesounding name of the Center for Policy Research.  Obviously  itis no research center of any kind  unless researching publisheddocuments to find material to use against Israel makes it so.     Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprisingin itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I wascurious if anyone knew who this anti Israel fanatic hiding behindhis phoney research center name is.  Is he an Arab   Is he sometypical anti semite hiding behind a veneer of anti zionism   Ishe some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldnt make itthere  and is now taking his failure out on Israel      Lets shed some light on this clown once and for all.

I would hardly consider the BDs to be Christian.  They were acting indirect contradiction to scripture.  Jesus Second Coming is somethingthat everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will befalse Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   Im not that annoyed about the adults  they knew supposedly what   they were doing  and its their own actions.      What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside    including mothers  let the children suffer and die during awful   conditions.  I agree with you there.    If this is considered religious following to the end  Im proud   that I dont follow such fanatical and non compassionate religions.  Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to laydown my life  it will be to save another life.    You might want to die for whatever purpose  but please spare   the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all.      I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity   knows about the word compassion. Christians  do you think    the actions today would produce a good picture of your    religion   Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would callthemselves Christian and yet are not   The BDs contradicted scripturein their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhapsyou have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask anytrue believing Christian and you will find that they will deny anyassociation with the BDs.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied anyfurther ties with this cult  which was what they were.Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein  a supposedly devout Muslim   I dont.

Flaming Nazis,Reply To  deane binah.cc.brandeis.eduOrganization  Brandeis UniversityLines  106Okay  Ill bite. I should probably leave this alone  but what the heck...In article  1993Apr14.124301.422 sun0.urz.uni heidelberg.de   gsmith lauren.iwr.uni heidelberg.de  Gene W. Smith  writes  In article  TT3R2B5w165w brewich.hou.tx.us  popec brewich.hou.tx.us  Pope Charles  writes    Rhoemer was the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms    and props used by the early Nazis in their rallies and such.  The name is Roehm  not Rhoemer.  And Hitler does claim that he came up with the Swastika business.But didnt he credit the actual flag design to a party member   some dentist orother  I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.  He was killed in an early Nazi purge. He and many of his associates  were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies.  I have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this common assertion recently.  Postings to such groups as soc.history and soc.culture.german has not uncovered any net.experts who could provide any. Well  Im no expert  but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. Theymake reference to several scandals that occurred long before  the night of thelong knives . The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions ofthe SA was common knowledge. Also  a book  by a homosexual author whose nameescapes me at the moment  called  Homosexuals in History  asserts that Roehmand Heines were homosexuals  as well as others in Roehms SA circle. All the books say that Roehm and his associate  Edmund Heines  were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that  and suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. Well  youre the one who is in Germany. If you dont believe the history books look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do nothave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty ofdocumented instances   several scandals  the fact that on the  knight of thelong knives  several SA members  including Heines  were found sleepingtogether  etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SAshomosexual activities  seducing young boys  etc . The histories that Ive read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.   Irving  a notoriously unreliable historian  says that Funk  the Nazi finance minister  was homosexual.  He gives no sources. I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely doyou know  that would contradict all of the other history books that I haveread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis  Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti homosexual smear  What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history  Dont you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.  I challenge anyone to document this claim.If you are going to challenge  all  historians on this point  not just Irving  then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out wherethe stories originate from. Again  you are the one in Germany  close toarchival material   most people on the net are not. I  have  found a great deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones  Hitler  Himmler  Goebbels  Goering  Heydrich  Eichmann  and many more.Eh  What is your agenda here  To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals  sothat you can bash heterosexuals  Does it bother you that some of the Nazismight have been homosexuals  Does this make all homosexuals bad if this istrue  Of course not. And what about bisexuals  Are they half Nazis I dont know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis werehomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1  for instance  was notoriousfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the Germangovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaisers friendswere prosecuted   the Kaiser was no homosexual  but the Germany army had a longtradition of tolerating homosexuality  going far back into Prussian history  back to Frederick the Great at least  who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition  and the old German army  like theEnglish public school system   being a well known center of homosexuality would have been quite willing to overlook Roehms homosexuality.In addition  some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. TheHitler Youth swallowed up all pre Nazi youth groups  and some of the various pre war Vandervogel  Bund  and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship  and in many cases  homosexuality itself. So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the  evils  of homosexuality.Why should this suprise anyone  Homosexuality has always existed  in all societies   it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.No  I dont have any sources for you  as I think the only kind of proof youwill accept would be citations from archival material  and I do not have access to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modernhomosexuality that I have ever read   I dont have the time. Nothing isstopping you  however  from chasing down those sources.

Big Brother  Clipper  chip,Summary  Some thoughts on the use of the Big Brother  Clipper  chipKeywords  clipperNntp Posting Host  well.sf.ca.usOrganization  The Whole Earth Lectronic Link  Sausalito  CALines  57     There are some issues which come to mind when one considersthe law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother Clipper  chip.     The drug dealers and terrorists arent going to letthemselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985the New York Times reported that government investigators brokeup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticatedequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring toeavesdrop on the law enforcement agents who were trying to arrestthem.     A Mr. Deely  an NSA official  said  There are a lot ofmedium sized countries that would have been proud to have thesignals intelligence operation of this group.      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people whohave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecurecommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip willonly increase their numbers.     Even if there is some benefit to law enforcement through theuse of Big Brother  it must be weighed against the constitutionaland civil liberties questions involved.     For example  in some areas of the world torture is used asan investigative tool by the local  law enforcement  people.  Isuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information andshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep theconviction rate high.     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country even with a court order obtained by showing  probable cause   isbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency andwhat is ethically and morally right.     I think that the same question of expediency versus moralityshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  Ivote for morality.     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threatto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip isnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the WhiteHouse press release I came away with that impression.     To most of the American public  the word  hacker  hasrightly or wrongly come to mean  high tech adolescent vandal .It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.cryptregarding this issue are intelligent  thoughtful individuals whohave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issuessurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother doesnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  Iwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech VolsteadAct.     The high speed digital communications revolution is comingat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing and just as IBM is learning that they cant do business the sameway they have done it for the past 40 years  maybe NSA shouldevaluate another approach.     EFF  who have correctly questioned the cryptographicstrength of Big Brother  may need to send a stronger message outregarding the constitutional issues involved.     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning  En quoi celavous concerne  cheri

what is it  ,Organization  Netcom Online Communications Services  408 241 9760 login  guest Lines  81In article rind enterprise.bih.harvard.edu  David Rind  writes  In article davpa ida.liu.se   David Partain  writes   Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans    a disease about which I can find no information.  Apparently it has something  to do with the bodys production of yeast while at the same time being highly  allergic to yeast.  Can anyone out there tell me any more about it  Candida albicans can cause severe life threatening infections  usually in people who are otherwise quite ill.  This is not  however  the sort of illness that you are probably discussing.   Systemic yeast syndrome  where the body is allergic to yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine.  There is a book  The Yeast Connection  which talks about this  illness .  There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.Theres a lot of evidence  it just hasnt been adequately gathered andpublished in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skepticswho quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used.For example  Dr. Ivker  who wrote the book  Sinus Survival   always gives before any other treatment  a systemic anti fungal  such as Nizoral  to hisnew patients IF theyve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more timesin the last two years.  Hes kept a record of the results  and for over 2000 patients found that over 90  of his patients get significant reliefof allergic sinus symptoms.  Of course  this is only the beginning for hisprogram.In my case  as I reported a few weeks ago  I was developing the classicsymptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection  I agree it is a poorly written book    e.g.  extreme sensitivity to plastics  vapors  etc. whichI never had before  started in November .  Within one week of full dosageof Sporanox  the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared   I cannow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  Im also greatly  improved in other areas as well.Of course  I have allergy symptoms  etc.  I am especially allergic tomolds  yeasts  etc.  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out thatif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body  and you have anatural allergy to yeasts  that a threshold would be reached where youwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also  yeast do produce toxins of varioussorts  and again  you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize thatsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinussince thats the center of my allergic response.  Of course  the  60 000question is whether a person who is immune compromised  as tests showed I wasfrom over 5 years of antibiotics  nutritionally deficiencies because of thestress of infections and allergies  etc.   can develop excessive yeastcolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer sincetesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has totake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately  Sporanox is relativelysafe unlike past anti fungals  still have to be careful  however  so theresno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.BTW  some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately  most yeast grows hyphaetoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  Youll finda lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.In summary  I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keepmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmlyto the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enoughactually treating patients.  If anybody  doctors included  said to me to myface that there is no evidence of the yeast connection  I cannot guaranteetheir safety.

This seems the crux to me  if you judge the Bible according to a long    line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day     rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact  then of course    it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values.  But if thats how the Bible is actually being used today  shouldnt that be how we should judge it   If most people use scissors to cut paper  shouldnt Consumers Reports test scissors for paper cutting ability  even though scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth Thats possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teachingJewish morality today  but it hardly seems fair to claim that thishighly interpreted version is what was  enlightened for its times .To  attempt to  extend the analogy  this is like saying that theoriginal scissor makers were unusually advanced at paper cutting fortheir times  even though they only ever cut cloth  and had never evenheard of paper.Im not arguing that the Bible is  disgusting   though some of thehistory depicted in it is  by modern standards.  However  history isfull of similar abuses  and I dont think the Biblical accounts areworse than their contemporaries  or possibly ours.  On the other hand I dont know of any reason to think the history described in the Bibleshows  less  abuse than their contemporaries  or ours.  That complexand benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythicinterpretations of that history is interesting  but I still dontthink it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use itto attack condemnation of the original history.

IDE vs SCSI,"Organization  XEL Communications  Inc.X Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL9 Lines  106Wayne Smith  wlsmith valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca  wrote   In article  1qk7kvINNndk dns1.NMSU.Edu  bgrubb dante.nmsu.edu  GRUBB  writes     point of view  why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi     tasking   Data is data  and it could be anywhere on the drive.  Can    SCSI find it faster   can it get it off the drive and into the computer    faster   Does it have a better cache system   I thought SCSI was good at    managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached.  If we are    only talking about a single drive  explain why SCSI is inherently    faster at managing data from a hard drive.   IDE   Integrated Device Electronics     currently the most common standard  and is mainly used for medium sized     drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer   5MB s max.  Why dont you start with the spec sheet of the ISA bus first   You can quote SCSI specs till youre blue in the face  but if they  exceed the ISA bus capability  then whats the point Who said ISA was necessary   EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worthinvesting thousands of dollars  e.g. a new pcs worth of money   in .  Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs sec   What about VLB IDE   Does anyone  know how they perform You didnt read to carefully.  VLB IDE uses the same connection mechanismas standard IDE.  If transfer rate is limited by IDE  whether itsinterfaced to ISA  EISA or VLB matters not.   So at its LOWEST setting SCSI 2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI 1 mode AVERAGES    the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI 2 mode   it blows poor IDE out the window  down the street  and into the garbage can.  As implimented on what system   On mine  for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water  hands down.  IfIDE has better throughput  why isnt it used on workstations and fileservers      The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put   rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI 2 comes from.  NOT   the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the   SCSI 2 through put.    Given the original question  SCSI used only as a single hard drive  controller    is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do  at least 5  maybe 10 megs sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence   What does a 200 400 meg 5 megs sec SCSI drive cost No  thats the nice thing    on a multitasking OS  SCSI can use both drivesat once.  Ive got unix loaded on one of my pcs  along with windogs  and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  Its pretty ugly.I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid  369 for it.  Ihavent seen IDE drives cheaper.  The original CGA cart back in 84 was  300.  I think the original EGA card   or PGA   was  800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down  in price  mainly because were talking about PCs and not Suns or Sparc  or SGI or  name your favorite unix workstation .  That is  after millions  of PC buying decisions over the years  SCSI has had plenty of time to  come down in price.No  actually  were talking about SCSI being expensive simply becausenobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common  read easily implemented  method of adding scsi to a PC  like as in a Sun orMac   then youd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  I wont argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good  well implimented  data highway  but I still want to know why it intrinsically better   than IDE  on an ISA bus  when it comes to multi tasking OSs when  managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.On a single drive  SCSI is more expensive.  But  you bought your PC forexpandibility  so  youd want to add more drives or whatever.  Thefollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE A  partial   list 	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them 	concurrently.	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines  I have a mac	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice	with SCSI    hook them up and away they go 	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For	instance  recently  I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor	212 meg IDE.  The connor  MUST  be setup as the slave.  It will	work no other way.  On SCSI  you set the address  check the	termination  plug it in  and away it goes.	4.  I have a problem with IDEs mutual exclusion   I notice that	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c  to drive d  is	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c 	to d  on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS  this is very	noticable  as many things can be going on at once.One neat thing that Ive noticed lately  a fringe benefit  has been theability to add older  almost dead  drives as storage on a SCSI system withlittle problem    weve got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that Iveadded to my PC.  Ive now got the interface full  but  it does allow me tohave 4 20 meg drives  1 240 meg drive  1 tape drive  and 1 105 meg driveall on the same card.  Simply put  SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.Greg.   _______________________________________________________________________________You cant go against nature  because when you do  	Greg Shawgo against nature  its part of nature too.		shaw feanor.xel.com 			Love   Rockets			uunet csn xel.com shaw  "

Minimum force  for a start. And  it   depends on what is being forced  on either side .          Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such    people out of necessity or self defence  while recognizing    that our own actions in doing so are not moral       My opinion is that our actions would be moral  and it would be   immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective.     Again  there many caveats and provisios.      Note  my usage of  my opinion  is an admission that I dont have a lock   on morals  not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on.Youre admitting a lot more than that.  You are admitting thatyour morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actionsof other people and the situation you are in help to determinehow you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.If you employ X degree of force  thats not moral  but if you employX degree of force  but previously someone else has employed Y degreeof force  and the situation is thus and so  that  is  moral.This is quite different from saying  Employing force on other peopleis immoral  period.   Unfortunately  from time to time we are obligedto do this immoral thing for reasons of self preservation  and sowe have to bear the moral consequences of that.For what its worth   and yes  I know you claim to be an agnostic  its this ability to re label things from  immoral  to  moral  that I find one of the  least  attractive qualities of the religiousmind.jon.

Creps  writes  In article  Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313 athos.rutgers.edu  jemurray magnus.acs.ohio state.edu  John E Murray  writes      On Palm Sunday at our parish  we were  invited  to take the role of Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins  so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd  but to no avail.   musicians  readers  and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the  liturgy and since no one knows whats happening  the new things have to be  explained  and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass were just  sitting there listening  or spacing out  in my case  to how the Mass is about  to be done.  In my mind  I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay  people to be aware of the Lords presence.As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran   it is some of the innovations  of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and returnto the more traditional Catholic Chuch   the Lutherans.I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate inthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish justinstituted the  Tenebrae  service for Good Friday and I was the lector for a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned thingsthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels   yet those  facts  werealways there.  As a matter of interest  the pastor and I were talking aboutthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week overbreakfast Easter Sunday.     As a member of a liturgy committee  I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating  who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests dont seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess its easier to  try something new  than it is to refuse to allow it.My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family  called musicand worship at our church .  Our pastor does have control of this committeebut listens very carefully to the committees suggestions.  It needs a stronghand to lead and guide  to keep the intent and the message clear and strongas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additionalreason for my leaving the Catholic faith   lack of any selfless spiritualguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA  wishy washy . As you may gather from my comments  I feel that it is very important  ir regardless of denominational guidelines  to have a service Mass which promotesthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in atraditional Mass  with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue  the Sacramentof PENANCE  not Reconciliation   Stations of the Cross  so on and so forth.The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelingsare not shared by everyone.I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord  but I dont want them attending a show.  Its not.  My church works hard to have a meaningfulservice during Lent on Wednesdays  but follow traditional Lutheran Book ofWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent  suchas the Hymn of Praise  it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that itis Not there.Quite frankly  it is very hard for a non Catholic to go to a Mass and  fit in .My dear wife never could  former Methodist .  And Holy Week Masses and Vigilswould intimidate the daylights out of a non Catholic.  Those Catholics whohave beared with me this far understand what I mean.Please keep in mind why we are there   to gather together in worship.  Notto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is somethingwrong that you feel needs addressing  by all means talk to your priest orpastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldnt listen.

Ive faced a knife.  And I was damn annoyed I didnt  have a gun.  All the statistics in the world didnt change the fact that he  was interested in cutting  me . Fortunately  the best defense against a knife isnt another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self defense wont have much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife assault  which probably means 99.9  of knife assailants .        Anyone trained in self defense.         Unarmed self defense isnt for everyone.  Whats more  it requiressubstantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm.It requires physical proximity and thus a greater threat to the victim which is a primary problem with stun guns.  You have to actually touchyour assailant.  Unless youre  very  good  a large  stronger assailantcan simply ignore your blows long enough to incapacitate you.

Homeopathy     tradition  ,Summary  Is subjective judgement more reliable than statistics  Organization  University of Hawaii  Mathematics Dept Expires  Mon  10 May 1993 10 00 00 GMTLines  76In article  ls8lnvINNrtb saltillo.cs.utexas.edu  turpin cs.utexas.edu      Russell Turpin  writes              ...   not  imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It  does  imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are incapable of discovering  which  treatments are effective and which are not. To start with  no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  Sotheres a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in agiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completelyand makes progress impossible.   Expenditure of sufficiently large sumsof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.   On the otherhand  with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whicheventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studiescontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying   You people callTHIS science      My opinion  for what its worth  is that one sees boththese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.   Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigorappropriate for a particular investigation.  I dont believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  My second point  though  is that highly capable people can often makeextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usingmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think thisis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approachtheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.Within mathematics  I think there are several examples  especially beforethe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann  who isfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.   Later mathematicians did prove them  of course.   I think that for a good scientist  empirical investigation is often notso much a matter of determining what is true and whats not  as it is a matter of convincing other people.   People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here  but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of ones results is anessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process  but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science. When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does andseems to be very successful at it  I think that his judgements are alsoworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtherinvestigation.  In article  C53By5.HD news.Hawaii.Edu  I wrote    Namely  is there really justification for the belief that  science is a superior path to truth than non scientific approaches   Admittedly  my question was not at all well posed.  A considerableamount of effort in a  serious scholarly investigation  such as Isuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer.  The  science  I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  I certainly wasnt thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of  reason and observation. One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whetherin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencedpractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am withthe study of scientific methodology  perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question.    In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists  psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady uhunix.bitnet

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems  small  micro  and large  super  alike.  Despite its small size and quickness  it has enough power to satisfy most users  including  standard x y plots  semilog plots  log log plots  contour plots  3D plots  mesh plots  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs  of the same or different sizes  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles  widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts  the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical  musical  and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available  system dependent   including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable  but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code  except header files and those files explicitly granting permission  may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that   1  it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available  and  2  the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code  especially in the form of user contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers  please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also  please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product  we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs  but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C  enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently  stub routines are provided to handle the C   Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file  plplot.h   see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc  directory in the form of several TeX files  please consult this for additional information  latex plotdoc .  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code  so dont be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult Changes.log to see a list of recent changes.   At present  PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems 	 Unix 	SunOS		 A IX 		 HP UX		 Unicos		 DG UX		 Ultrix		 SysV		 Linux	 Amiga Exec	 MS DOS	 OS 2	 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system  see     appendices to the PLPLOT manual    system specific documentation in the appropriate sys  system  directory.

If I claim something is a general trend  then to disprove this   I guess youd have to show that it was not a general trend. No  if youre going to claim something  then it is up to you to prove it. Think  Cold Fusion .Well  Ive provided examples to show that the trend was general  and you or others  have provided some counterexamples  mostly ones surroundingmating practices  etc.  I dont think that these few cases are enough todisprove the general trend of natural morality.  And  again  the matingpractices need to be reexamined...  Try to find  immoral  non mating related activities. So youre excluding mating related activities from your  natural morality  No  but mating practices are a special case.  Ill have to think about itsome more.  Yes  I think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the  goal of species propogation in mind.  But  I am not equating the two  as you so think.  That is  an objective system isnt necessarily the  natural one. Are you or are you not the man who wrote   A natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals  follow .Indeed.  But  while the natural system is objective  all objective systemsare not the natural one.  So  the terms can not be equated.  The naturalsystem is a subset of the objective ones. Now  since homosexuality has been observed in most animals  including birds and dolphins   are you going to claim that  most animals  have the capacity of being immoral I dont claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isnt harmful  althoughit isnt helpful either  to the mating process .  And  when you say thathomosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom  dont you mean  bisexuality      Because we cant determine to what end we should be  moral.  Are you claiming to be a group    We  usually implies more than one entity.This is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The  we  forms are usedthroughout.  Well  Im saying that these goals are not inherent.  That is why they must  be postulates  because there is not really a way to determine them  otherwise  although it could be argued that they arise from the natural  goal  but they are somewhat removed . Postulate  To assume  posit.Thats right.  The goals themselves arent inherent. I can create a theory with a postulate that the Sun revolves around the Earth  that the moon is actually made of green cheese  and the stars are the portions of Angels that intrudes into three dimensional reality.You could  but such would contradict observations. I can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length of one side of a triangle  the length of a second side of the triangle  and the degree of angle connecting them  I can determine the length of the third side.But a postulate is something that is generally  or always  found to betrue.  I dont think your postulate would be valid. Guess which one people are going to be more receptive to.  In order to assume something about your system  you have to be able to show that your postulates work.Yes  and I think the goals of survival and happiness  do  work.  You thinkthey dont   Or are they not good goals keith

DEPOSITION OF YURI VAGARSHAKOVICH MUSAELIAN   Born 1953   Line Electrician   Sumgait Streetcar and Trolleybus Administration   Resident at Building 4 21  Apartment 29   Block 14  Narimanov Street   Sumgait  Azerbaijan I spent almost all of February doing overhaul. The 27th was a short day atwork  we worked until eleven or eleven thirty and left for home. I decidedto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the EternalFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I hadwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakesbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ 24Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed  in a suit and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesnt have anything on her head  and her hair is let down  sightly reddish hair  a heavy set woman. Theyre 40 to 45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to helpthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didnt see what it was  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circlearound it. I ask   Whats going on   Someone tells me   Come listen.  Wellthey were Azerbaijanis  I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals   BrotherMuslims  our time has come . . .   and something else along that line. Ididnt understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. New people started coming from various directions  five here  seven there. Andthe comments started   Right  we should slaughter the Armenians   and  Theresno need to be afraid  all of Moscow is behind us.  I even heard that   All Moscow is behind us.  Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke. I quietly left and went home.Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh  that there were demonstrations there. Well  people were saying all kinds of things  but I didnt have any idea what was really going on.My wife and son were at home  but my daughter was at my aunts house in Baku. I didnt say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around twooclock right behind our house suddenly there is noise  whistling  and shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly.My wife asks whats going on out there. I say I dont know. I put on someoutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowdpeople are shouting  Down with the Armenians   and  Death to the Armenians   Iwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee  then they turned and went against the traffic  its one way there  down the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside from the things they were shouting  I was surprised that there were only youngpeople in the crowd. And they were minors  under draft age.My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend  but I was kind ofuneasy and said   No  lets stay at home instead.  An hour went by  or maybe an hour and a half. Well  I wasnt keeping track of the time  I cant sayexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov  but now onthe side with the microdistricts  the bazaar  and the Rossiya movie theater.I put outside clothes on and went out again. Theres noise  an uproar outside and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time there were individual shouts  this time they are more focused  more aggressive. No  I think  somethings wrong here  this isnt any demonstration.They would run  stop  then walk quickly and make sharp dashes  and then run again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I followed them. I was thinking Id just watch and see. Who knew where this was leading  We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one side  and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting  as though the whole town had turned out. There was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations  appeals.I heard both anti Armenian and anti Soviet appeals.  We dont need perestroika  we want to go on living like we have been.  Now what did they mean by  living like we have been   The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. Speculation  theft  and cheating go on all the time. And not just in Azerbaijan  everywhere  in all the republics  but Ive never seen it anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians apartments and drive them out  beat them and drive them out. True  I didnt hear them say  kill them  over the microphone  I only heard  beat them and drive them out.  I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one  thenanother are going up onto the stage  and no one tries to stop the crowd. Offto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people  and I think they were MVD  Ministry of Internal Affairs  or State Security KGB.There were also uniformed policemen there  but I didnt see any of them try to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.Well I had finally decided that this could end badly  This was nodemonstration  and I had to protect my family.I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was nextto the City Party Committee  on Narimanov Street  it stood next to the tai lors shop there  a low truck  and it had low  wooden panels. I see that some thing is being unloaded  crates of some sort. I decided to go look becauseafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weaponsin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square  not toward the City Party Committee  but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck  and on the ground there were many people  15 to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people. Two people  one case of vodka. And there was a man standingright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps  maybe about the size of a fist  maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. When I passed next to that person  he stood with his side to me. There was about a yard and a half between us  and two people were standing near him. He has a package in his hand  and hes pulling out anasha and handing it out. I have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun  but Ive seen a lot of people smoke it  Ive seen it many times  and I know what it is. I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling  more warlike shouting. I turned around and saw them running. Well Ill just keep on going like I am  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street. Hes a young guy  21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag  which had  Ermeni oryum  written on it in Azerbaijani  that means  Death to Armenians   That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I dont reallyknow what his name is  but I know his father very well. His fathers name isRafik  he used to be a cook  and then became head chef. He used to have a darkblue Zhiguli van  then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His family  as I said  lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on Narimanov Street  and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars  their apartment was in the far entryway  on the fifth floor  the door on the left. Now Rafiks little brother lives there  and he  Rafik  I heard  got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word  his son was carrying a flag that said  Death to Armenians   I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait  but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her   Its OK  itll pass  theyre young kids  theyve just gotten all whooped up.  Naturally I didnt want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking  but I couldnt see where. Well I think  here we go  the machines in motion. They werent handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didnt see people drinking and smoking on the spot  but they certainly hadnt unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running  no one would stop them now  they werent even trying  although  Ill say it again  the police were there  I saw them. And its not just that the police werent breaking them up  they were joking with them  they were having a good time. True  at the time I couldnt even imagine that under our government  our much vaunted leadership  and Im not afraid to say these words  so many people died  So many women were abused  and how many abominations there were   I couldnt imagine that under our much vaunted authorities  and if I were to be specific  I would say under the much touted authorities in our city of Sumgait  I couldnt imagine that such things could take place.When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son   Lets go upstairs.  We went to our neighbors  the Grigorians  on the fourth floor. And in the evening  when those crowds started going past again  I went outside once more.I stopped at  The Corner   a place called that right next to the bazaar. I look and see a crowd on the run. And there  a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar  are three respectable looking men of around  say  50 years old. The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd  as though it were one person  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three  as though it were off limits  Well everything got all churned up  there was more noise  and the glass was flying again.We spent the night at the neighbors. My apartment was on the first floor there was really no way to defend yourself there.In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. On the way I saw someone hunched up  still. I never found out who it was or what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the bread and on my way back  they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up  sort of enclosing him  because of the way they were standingyou couldnt even see him.That was on the morning of February 28.

Gibbons Outlines SSF Redesign Guidance,News Software  VAX VMS VNEWS 1.41    Nntp Posting Host  tm0006.lerc.nasa.govOrganization  NASA Lewis Research Center   Cleveland  OhioLines  76NASA Headquarters distributed the following pressrelease today  4 6 . Ive typed it in verbatim  for youfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recentlydiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign GuidanceDr. John H. Gibbons  Director  Office of Science andTechnology Policy  outlined to the members designate ofthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the SpaceStation on April 3  three budget options as guidance tothe committee in their deliberations on the redesign ofthe space station.A low option of  5 billion  a mid range option of  7billion and a high option of  9 billion will beconsidered by the committee. Each option would coverthe total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds fordevelopment  operations  utilization  Shuttleintegration  facilities  research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within theavailable funds.Over the next 5 years   4 billion is reserved withinthe NASA budget for the Presidents new technologyinvestment. As a result  station options above  7billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions inthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example  a spacestation option of  9 billion would require  2 billionin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.Gibbons presented the information at an organizationalsession of the advisory committee. Generally  themembers designate focused upon administrative topicsand used the session to get acquainted. They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientationon the process the Station Redesign Team is followingto develop options for the advisory committee toconsider.Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners    the Europeans  Japanese  andCanadians    have decided  after consultation  to give full consideration  to use of Russian assets in thecourse of the space station redesign process.To that end  the Russians will be asked to participatein the redesign effort on an as needed consultingbasis  so that the redesign team can make use of theirexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and thepossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities andsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope tobenefit from the expertise of the Russian participantsin assessing Russian systems and technology. Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to developoptions for reducing station costs while preserving keyresearch and exploration capabilities. Carefulintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor inachieving that goal.Gibbons reiterated that   President Clinton iscommitted to the redesigned space station and to makingevery effort to preserve the science  the technologyand the jobs that the space station program represents.However  he also is committed to a space station thatis well managed and one that does not consume thenational resources which should be used to invest inthe future of this industry and this nation. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East West Space Science Center at the University of Marylandunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

Homosexuality issues in Christianity,Organization  University of Arizona  TucsonLines  75Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral  otherthan Leviticus  So far  when I ask  around here  I get the verses fromLeviticus spouted at me  but the whole rest of that book tends to beignored by Christians  havent seen any stonings in a _long_ time    .Later Max  Bob  Muir The list was posted not long ago  as I recall  aside from Lev  commonlycited passages are the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape  andtheres no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediateposition on this  note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in theBible for its sinfulness.  It doesnt seem to have been knownspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather  I think it was considered acesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the actiondescribed.   It almost seems to have been contrived to combine aboutas many forms of evil in one act as possible  homosexual rape ofguests  who were actually angels.   But this story is not specificallyabout homosexuality.In the NT  the clear references are all from Pauls letters.  In Rom1  there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.Note that the passage isnt about homosexuality    its aboutidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment  or atleast result  of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over thispassage.  It does not use the word  homosexuality   and it is referringto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.So its not what Id call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality.The other passages occur in lists of sins  in I Cor 6 9  and I Tim1 10.  Unfortunately its not entirely clear what the words used heremean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning such as  wanton   and that another may be specifically  maleprostitute .  Again  we dont have here a precise teaching abouthomosexuality  but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paulshared the OTs negative judgement on homosexuality.Jude 1 7 is sometimes cited  however its probably not relevant.  Thecontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped inSodom were angels  it seems likely that  strange flesh  refers tointercourse with angels.As you can see  the NT evidence is such that peoples conclusion isdetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note thatthe passages from Pauls letters imply that he accepted the OTprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NTendorsement.  Liberals note that theres no specific teaching  and noclear definition of what is being prohibited or why  is the concern inRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship   what exactlydo the words in the lists of sins mean  .  Thus some believe it islegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from hisbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.This is an explosive topic  which tends to result in longdissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But itsclear to me that thats mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes downto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether theybelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  Thisappears to depend upon ones reaction to the message of the Bible as awhole  as well as ones perception of the needs of the church today.This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the differencebetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent  and one where bothsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that theykeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and theother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes thingsvery frustrating for a moderator  who realizes that such an optimisticoutcome is not very likely...  clh

Itd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsens contract to be Keenans assistant ...  Roger did do a very good job with the mediocre players  just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks of 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those Canucks last May ...

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL team since the inception of the DH rule.   p.s. any ideas what this is    They will fall easily short of 600 runs  thats for damn sure.  I cant believe these media fools picking them to win the division  like our Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of genius for the trades aquisitions hes made      Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in 65 or 66   True Cone is probably as good as Drysdale  and they have no Koufax  but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals  withlots of low scoring games  etc.  And they didnt use relievers  whereasJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.     That being said  I still picked them 5th or so  but I think a superbpitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  Theres more of achance of that  I think  than of a team with tremendous hitting but nopitching.  At least  to me.     I wonder  though   which one do you people think would do better   a teamwith Johnson  Koufax in his prime  Seaver  Carlton  and Young  in no realorder  as the starters  with Sutter  Fingers  and Lyle in the bullpen  butwith a puny offense  assuming good defense  like Mazeroski  Maranville  etc. Or a team with poor pitching  but with an offense of Cobb  Carew  Ruth  Gehrig Mays  Schmidt  Wagner  and Bench   again you pick the order.     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better byseasons end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2 5 of the time intheir best years  but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts   taking allthe players in their prime  they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And allthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under thetire   so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road. 2  Tires age.

Theres a lot of evidence  it just hasnt been adequately gathered and  published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics  who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used. Snort.  Ah  there go my sinuses again.  For example  Dr. Ivker  who wrote the book  Sinus Survival   always gives  Oh  wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey  they laughed at Einstein  too   before any other treatment  a systemic anti fungal  such as Nizoral  to his  new patients IF theyve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more times  in the last two years.  Hes kept a record of the results  and for over   2000 patients found that over 90  of his patients get significant relief  of allergic sinus symptoms.  Of course  this is only the beginning for his  program. Yeah  Ill bet.  Tomorrow  the world. Listen  uncontrolled studies like this are worthless.  In my case  as I reported a few weeks ago  I was developing the classic  symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection  I agree it is a poorly   written book    e.g.  extreme sensitivity to plastics  vapors  etc. which  I never had before  started in November .  Within one week of full dosage  of Sporanox  the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared   I can  now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  Im also   greatly  improved in other areas as well. Im sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to  miracle cures.   Of course  I have allergy symptoms  etc.  I am especially allergic to  molds  yeasts  etc.  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that  if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body  and you have a  natural allergy to yeasts  that a threshold would be reached where you  would have perceptible symptoms. Yeah   it makes sense to me   so of course it should be taken seriously. Snort.  Also  yeast do produce toxins of various  sorts  and again  you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that  such toxins can cause problems in some people. Yeah   it sounds reasonable to me .  Of course  the  60 000  question is whether a person who is immune compromised  as tests showed I was  from over 5 years of antibiotics  nutritionally deficiencies because of the  stress of infections and allergies  etc.   Oh  really   _What_ tests   Immune compromised  my ass. More like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome.  can develop excessive yeast  colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since  testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to  take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately  Sporanox is relatively  safe unlike past anti fungals  still have to be careful  however  so theres  no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons. You know  its a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way.  Its ridiculously expensive  and potentially toxic. The trouble is that it isnt toxic enough  so it gets abused by quacks.  BTW  some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately  most yeast grows hyphae  too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  Youll find  a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time. The only good thing about nystatin is that its  relatively  cheap and when taken orally  non toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect  so unless it were given IV  it would be without any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve the  yeast  problem once and for all.  In summary  I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep  medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly  to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough  actually treating patients.  If anybody  doctors included  said to me to my  face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection  I cannot guarantee  their safety.  For their incompetence  ripping off their lips is justified as  far as I am concerned. Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms. Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket   Id hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this. Steve DyerDyer  youre rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. Itsoften practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment ofnon life threatening illness is done on a guess  hazarded after anecdotalevidence given by the patient. Its an educated guess  by a trained person but its still no more than a guess.Its cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with thosepeople who dont respond.There are diseases that havent been described yet and the root cause of manydiseases now described arent known.  Read a book on gastroenterologysometime if you want to see a lot of them.  After scientific methods haverun out then its the patients freedom of choice to try any experimentalmethod they choose. And its well recognized by many doctors that medicinedoesnt have all the answers.This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe its amiracle cure  maybe its valid. How do you know   You might argue with the reasoning  the conclusions. But your disparagingattack is unwarranted. Why dont you present an convincing argument for your beliefs  instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack. Jackie

Why shouldnt cost and safety be used at least in part  to determine legality Id like to see you  prove  that drug legalization is an idiotic idea.Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative asWilliam F. Buckley supports it.  My point was that it is pretty stupid to justify legalizing something just because it will be safer and cheaper.   A few more ideas to hold to these criterion   prostitution  the killing of all funny farm patients  AIDS  victims   elderly  unemployed  prisioners  etc.   this would surely make my taxes decrease.Your examples  except for prostitution  fail miserably to meet both criteria safer AND cheaper .

Young Catchers,"Article I.D.  news.12799Organization  BiochemistryLines  139Nntp Posting Host  bruchner.biochem.duke.eduSince I was the one responsible for these divergent threads ofapprox. 40  posts  going back to  The Braves could be better offif an injury happens   I may as well inject a little morefuel to the flame 1   Back at the beginning of Spring Training  I thoughLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was stillrecovering from his late season injury  knee  I believe  and there were questions as to whether he would beable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.I was looking forward to this  because I believe that Lopezcan hit AND field the position.  Before last season  he wasthe Braves  Defensive Catcher  prospect  while Brian Deak wasthe Braves  Offensive Catcher  prospect.  Besides  Olsonand Berryhill couldnt hit their way out of a wet cardboardbox  and dont walk enough to be useful.But Olson recovered quickly  Berryhill recovered  and the Braves wentwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been downat the start of the season  he wouldnt have gotten his job back.2   There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.After all  ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear andtear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher California and Seattle come to mind .  Certainly  trying tomove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.Plus  youd have to eat that salary  which isnt huge  but isnttiddleywinks either  I think Olsons at about  800 000  Berryhillat  450 000  but thats only what I recall .3   Yes  I think arbitration eligibility may have a role toplay in this also.  What is it  that 5 6 of the 2 year playersarent eligible for arbitration    Only the 1 6 that were on the rosterthe longest are eligible   Of course  the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a businessstandpoint  it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June thefirst time Olson Berryhill go on the DL.4   I am still disappointed that Lopez isnt on the team.I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves and the truth is that Id rather see our best team on the field which  IMO  includes Lopez.Of course today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully  we wont need him.   As for the Schuerholz Cox conversation  I imagine it wentlike this    Remember  theyve BOTH been GMs  the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired Cox   OK  weve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be alittle smoother.  Besides  Blauser can hit OK and his fieldingis better than it used to be.Schuerholz   Well  well have to send Nieves down too.  Deionjust wont sign that baseball only contract.  We cant counton him in October  so we have to keep Nixon around for thedefense.  Besides  Gormans not ready to give up onBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatchers gone AND Deion signs we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought togive us some pitching depth in 1995.Cox   Yep  thatll be nice.  Too bad Deion wont sign.OK  Ill look for Nieves when Justice starts havingBerry Berry...er  back problems again.  Now  what aboutKlesko Schuerholz   Well  weve still got to fork out another 1.5 milfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko  we either lose the moneyor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell but somehow he doesnt seem to be the same GM.  FirstJeffries for Jose  and now Whiten for Clark   If hegets rid of Brian Jordan  then Id HAVE to believe that heand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings Cox   OK  keep trying on Bream  and Ill wait til the tradingdeadline for my Hunter Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a fewextra at bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...if Snow starts slowly  maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.And if that doesnt work  then perhaps Sids kneescould be  persuaded  to act up.  Theres always the15 day DL   Mwa ha ha ha ha Schuerholz   What about Caraballo Cox   Well  hes not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he startsin Richmond  hell start walking more.  Besides  if hes going to bearbitration eligible  better to stretch him out so that we actuallyget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.Schuerholz   Now  lets see.  That leaves Lopez.Cox   NOOOOO   I gotta keep Lopez   Sure  I didnt think Olsonwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti intorunning into him again Schuerholz   Nope  Lopez has gotta go.  You know that hell get 3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that oneextra year.  Besides  until Olsons shown his stuff a littlebit  I cant trade him.  Besides  Berryhills a left handedhitter.  You know how rare that is Cox   Dont you mean a left handed whiffer   Pretty common if you ask me.  I mean  he made Pat Borders look good inthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS   Schuerholz   Hey  youre the one who wouldnt write Lopezinto the lineup.Cox   Well  youre the one who went out and got me JeffReardon   Besides  I thought Lopez wouldnt be usedto our pitching staffs stuff.  He got some time withthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on  surelywe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate Schuerholz   Yeah  but which stiff   Whichever one we keepwill be hurt by May.Cox   OK  OK  you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surelyone of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then Ican call up Lopez  and then we can win 110 games   The Pennant THE WORLD SERIES   Ill be up there with John McGraw   CaseyStengel   Earl Weaver   Oh  they laughed at me in Toronto but have you ever had to deal with George Bell   Ill finallyget my just reward   Mwa ha ha ha Schuerholz   Easy  Bobby.

Not since the Yankees      of the 20s and 30s has a team been so nicely setup as this years and      years to come  Braves. I dont think that the All Star team will be able     This may be an appropriate comparison.   The 1929 31 Yankees finshed 2nd  3rd and 2nd finshing    18  16 and 13 1 2 games out of first.    In 1933 34 and 35 they also finished second   though they were only   7  7 and 3 games out .   Even great teams can lose   Thats why they play the season.    on the other hand... Im still picking the Braves to go all the way   Um  surely you didnt intend to compare the 93 Reds with the  29 Philidelphia As.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to  a team that was as good as the 26 28 Yankees  while the  Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig  couldnt play every position simultaneously.    IMO  given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season   that the Braves will be closer to their peak  while the Reds  have slightly passed their peak.    Also  if youre going to compare Braves and Yankees  a more appropriate  comparison to the 93 Braves might be the 23 Yankees.    After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series    both teams won will win the Series this year  despite the  heroics of some old fart on the other team.

Why do you think this And anyway  humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.  So  only intelligent beings can be moral  even if the bahavior of other  beings mimics theirs  You are starting to get the point.  Mimicry is not necessarily the  same as the action being imitated.

Which is ridiculous.       Once again I have over estimated the general level of intellegence of  the average reader of rush limbaugh.  Canada PER CAPITA spend more  money on people where the US spend more money PER CAPITA on guns. What exactly do you mean when you say the U.S. spends more per capita on guns than Canada does   Are you talking about the U.S. government or are you talking about the purchase of guns by private citizens or both   If you are referring to private citizens then your point is irrevelant because what individuals do with their money is essentially  their  business. If  on the other hand  you meant that the U.S government spends more per capita on guns than Canada does then your point  is  relevant.  So  if this is true then the U.S. needs to get its priorities straight.  People are more important than guns.  That is not to say that guns arent important.  Im just saying that if the U.S government  does  spend more per capita on guns than they do on people then something is awry.    He meant the US spends more per capita on guns than Canada which isntreally surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world fromthe USSR that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending.    I would like to see if the US spends more per capita on people than Canada does.  This is a true apples   apples comparison where the previouspost was apples   oranges.

Without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism  Heres the  main  problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably consistent  but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only doesnot support it  but indicates something far different. The Earth  bylatest estimates  is about 4.6 billion years old  and has had life forabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for  atmost  about 200 000 years. But  the fossil evidence inidcates that lifehas been changing and evolving  and  in fact  disease ridden  long beforethere were people.  Yes  there are fossils that show signs of disease...mostly bone disorders  of course  but there are some.  Heck  not justfossil evidence  but what weve been able to glean from genetic study showsthat disease has been around for a long  long time. If human sin was whatbrought about disease  at least  indirectly  though necessarily  thenhow could it exist before humans                               God created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw.  And without getting sidetracked into the theological ramifications of the original sin  the main effect of the so called original sin for this discussion was to remove humanity from Gods protection since by their choice A E cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with God.  In addition  their sin caused them to come under the dominion of Satan  who then assumed dominion over the earth... deletions  Since humanity was no longer under Gods protection but under Satans dominion  it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer diseases  both bacterial viral and genetic.  Although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species  the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists  who know more aboutbiology than you claim to  who will strongly disagree with this. Thereis no evidence that the human genetic code  or any other  started offin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment  in acollective sense. Im really curious as to what you mean by thedegeneration of the genetic code. Human DNA  being more  complex   tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease  while the  simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination. Umm. Nah  we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses andbacteria  and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife isharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalbyconstant in size  but the ranks keep changing. For example  bubonicplague used to be a really nasty disease  Im sure youll agree. Butit still pops up from time to time  even today... and doesnt do asmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation  but evenwhen people get the disease  the symptoms tend to be less severe than inthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptibledied off long ago  and because the really nasty variants overgrazed  forgive the poor terminology  Im an engineer  not a doctor        anddied off for lack of nearby hosts. I could be wrong on this  but from what I gather acne is only a fewhundred years old  and used to be nastier  though no killer. It seems tobe getting less nasty w age...                                                           Hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic  viral  and bacterial diseases disorders. Now  wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect  right And  you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. Itseems unlikely that Satan  whos making the diseases  would also gifthumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases lesslethal  if he wants survivors. As far as I can see  our immune systems imperfect though they may  presently   be  must have been built into usby God. I want to be clear on this  are you saying that God was planningahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immunesystem that was not  at the time of design  necessary  That is  God madeour immune systems ahead of time  knowing that Adam and Eve would sin andtheir descendents would need to fight off diseases  This may be more of a mystical supernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept  but God is not responsible for disease. Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease  evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook Gods protection. Heres another puzzle. What  exactly  do you mean by perfect in thephrase  created... perfect and without flaw  To my mind  a perfectsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A perfect systemthat will  without constant intervention  become imperfect is  not  aperfect system. At least  IMHO. Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on abunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmers glue  That is  theoriginal genetic instructions were perfect  but were written ininferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart If so  why could God not have used better materials  Was God  incapable  of creating a system that could maintain itself of did It just choose not to  deletions  In summary  newborns are innocent  but God does not cause their suffering. My main point  as I said  was that there really isnt any evidence forthe explanation you give.  At least  that Im aware of.  But  I couldnthelp making a few nitpicks here and there.    Sincerely Ray Ingles                     The above opinions are probably                               not those of the University ofingles engin.umich.edu         Michigan. Yet.

Most of us already are in this situation  our car makers have keys to our cars  or can get them quickly from the VIN  number   and I have no doubt that if presented with a court order  theyd surrender copies to the government. Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks theyve installed  and in an emergency can cut keys  thus theyd also provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.    Of course  nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cashand installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match somearbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone whohad fixed his locks in this way   his house  office and cars all tookthe same key  which he took GOOD care of     The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they have a court order. Bad analogy.    Very bad  yours  that is . Have you ever had a safety deposit box They work on a two key system. The bank clerk has one  and you havethe other  they are different keys . The bank does NOT keep a copy ofyour key. If you lose it  they have to drill out the lock  and replacethe door. This is a time consuming and expensive process  which theywill be happy to charge to your account    .     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key whichis NOT in a escrow system  and the state having to crack your cipherto get the data.     Please do not use false analogies.

Is MSG sensitivity superstition ,"Organization  USC  Department of Computer ScienceLines  39Frequently of late  I have been reacting to something added torestaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat startsto feel  puffy   like I have a cold  and also at times the inside of mymouth  especially the tongue  and lips also feel puffy.The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants usually chinese   the most notable cases   a cheap chinese fast foodchain  a japanese steak house  I had the steak   and another chinesefast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two ofwhat looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.I am under the impression that MSG  enhances  flavor by causing thetaste buds to swell.  If this is correct  I do not find it unreasonableto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.Also  as the many of the occurances  including two of the above involved beef  and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG  this iswhat I suspect as being the cause.I wouldnt be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animalsshowed it as being harmless  as it would be very startling to hear a labrat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives aretotally harmless is welcome to e mail me with the results of any studiedthey know of.

The crucial   thing is not to sit around just having fantasies  they arent of any use   unless they make you do some experiments.  Ive known a lot of scientists   whose fantasies lead them on to creative work  usually they wont admit   out loud what the fantasy was  prior to the consumption of a few beers.       Simple example  Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA   electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited  hoping that   hed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic   genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out   binding assays.  The result was a well conserved  400 or so bp  sequenceBut why do you characterize this as a  flight of fancy  or a  fantasy  While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here  it appears obviousthat his speculation  for lack of a better or more neutral word  wasat least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptanceof current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear thatsomething quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observationinto that theory  or to tailor the theory to cover the observation .  Thisdoes not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight offancy or a fantasy.      It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps   you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out   for perfectly rational reasons  or interesting new theories that were first   advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from   modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.Well  I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word  also  extra scientific   etc. .  Nor am I prepared to give a general account ofrationality.  In terms of examples  there is some danger of beginning to quibbleover what a  surprising  experiment is  what counts as  surprising   etc.The same may be said about  logical grounds .  My point is that quite frequently perhaps even most frequently  the roots of a new theory can be traced topreviously existing theories  or even to previously rejected hypotheses ofsome other theory or domain .  I would offer some rather well known examplessuch as Toricellis Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his  sea of air hypothesis.  Was this theory  and the resulting experimental test   surprising  Well  given the  prior  explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly mustbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed  and the experiment designed out of  perfectly rational grounds    Well  there was a pretty successful andwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid  but this was  quite  a noveltyat the time .  Was the theory interesting   Yes.  Was it  new    Well  onecould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a newdomain  but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if youlike.   Gary H.

The fact is  theyre losing the    battle.   In 1985 more than 23  of youths ages 12 to 17 said    they smoked marijuana  in 1991 that figure was 13   and Bonner    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday  April 14  1993issue of USA Today   Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth graders  by MikeSnider  p. 6D .

I think you can see that oneof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression thatthe  war on drugs  is being won is to selectively quote statistics   only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gonedown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post isan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt todeceive the public.Usage of  one  particular drug may have gone down but at the sametime usage of other drugs may have gone  up   a.k.a. substitution .Also  drug usage among  one  particular age group may have gone downbut drug usage among another age group may have gone  up .  Therefore if one takes a look at the big picture  taking into consideration  all the statistics  then its obvious that the so called  war on drugs  isbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugsgo  but if one factors in alcohol abuse  smoking  and use of inhalants then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placedin its true perspective.For those of you who dont consider alcohol to be a drug then trydrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell methat its not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after  illegal drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitlessattempt at preventing substance abuse   people will merely switch toanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be tolegalize some   not all   drugs whose toxicity has been shown to bewithin reasonable limits  you wont drop dead after using it a fewtimes  and then couple this with a massive drug education program.The reason why I think legalization is  part  of the solution isbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite thegovernments efforts to the contrary   the money spent on druginterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere  e.g.  drugeducation .  Additionally  legalization would reduce crime becausethe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which oftengoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact thataddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for theirmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fallsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.IMHO  the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has beendone to smokers   make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try toemploy heavy handed law enforcement and punish people by incarceratingthem.  As you already know  people in the U.S. smoke a lot less thanthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been broughtabout by public awareness campaigns  laws restricting where people canlight up  warning labels on cigarette packages  taxation on tobacco inorder to reduce consumption  and so on.  I propose that similar methodsbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carriedout.  They are as follows       Drugs being sold must come with clear  concise information which      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law      enforcement.      Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors  people under the age of      18 .  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning      information should also be a felony.      Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad      drugs   something that is a fairly serious problem now.Im sure that many of the things Ive discussed in this article havebeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.

Biblical Rape ,Nntp Posting Host  okcforum.osrhe.eduOrganization  Okcforum Unix Users GroupX Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL6 Lines  65Jim Perry  perry dsinc.com  wrote    Xenophobia  both  de facto  and  de jure  as implemented   in legal systems  is widespread  while the Bible    although not 100  egalitarian  specifically preaches   kindness to the stranger  and emphasizes in the Book   of Ruth  that a foreigner can join the nation and   give rise to one of the great heroes of the nation.    Clearly better than the alternative  but as an American what strikes  me as strange about this story is that it should have even been  considered an issue.Jim There are a couple of things about your post and others in this threadthat are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things canbe understood as processes of nature   exclusively. There is no needfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There isno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required byphysics  chemistry  biology  etc.  everything is random  nothing isdetermnined.This would also have to include human intelligence of course and allits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that itacquire intelligence  its just a happy accident. For an atheist  noevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or lessvalue than another in any naturalistic sense  and no thought  about an event can have value. The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment from teaching  training  observation and experience and are onlysignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mentalprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electricalactivity and nothing more  content is of no consequence. The humanmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down ahill.How then can an atheist judge value  What is the basis for criticizingthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God  Onwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned  Itseems that  in judging the values that motivate others to action  youhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured  but whatin nature can serve that purpose  What law of nature can you invoke toestablish your values.Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event  whatdifference could it possibly make what  anyone  does  religious orotherwise  there can be no  meaning  or gradation of value. The onlyway an atheist can object to  any  behaviour is to admit that theobjection is entirely subjective and that he she  just doesnt like it  thats it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimerthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carriesno weight in any  absolute  sense.That you dont like what God told people to do says nothing about Godor Gods commands  it says only that there was an electrical event in yournervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupledwith a pre existing thought set to form that reaction. That yourobjections  seem  well founded is due to the way youve beenconditioned  there is no  truth  content. The whole of yourintellectual landscape is an illusion  a virtual reality.I didnt make these rules  its inherent in naturalistic atheism andto be consistent  you have to accept the non significance of any humanthought  even your own. All of this being so  you have excludedyourself from any discussion of values  right  wrong  goood  evil etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have noweight whatsoever.Bill

Robert Weiss writes  a promise from Psalm 9 10  Gee  since you wouldnt be at all hypocritical  you must be really busy arguing against these out of context extracted translations He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy  again based on a lack ofresponse to an article by Robert Weiss  toward Stephen.I pointed out that I did  in fact  agree that both Robert Weiss andJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence  I find it difficult tounderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say  I donthave time to reply to  every  article on t.r.m. that takes a quoteout of context.  I asked Jim the following   So  according to you  Jim  the only way to criticize one person for  taking a quote out of context  without being a hypocrite  is to post a  response to  every  person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context Jim replied by saying  Did I either ask or assert that But today we find four articles from Jim  one of which has the subject Silence is concurrence    m23364 mwunix.mitre.org  James Meritt  writes  Is it not the case that  in the eyes of the law  when someone is aware of something and has the capability of taking action and does not  that individual may be held responsible for that action Which is  of course  a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out ofcontext isnt a crime.  I dont have time to read every article ont.r.m.  and Im certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.Does  silence is concurrence  imply that Jim thinks that because Ididnt respond to Weiss articles I must condone Weiss taking quotesout of context   Jim doesnt want to give a direct answer to thisquestion  read what he has written and decide for yourself.But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jims next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when heconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to providethe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.Today we find another obscure article  posting it twice didnt helpmake it more clear  Jim   titled  Inductive Logic   Scenario  A white goose waddles past the door A white goose waddles past the door A white goose waddles past the door ...  repeat an uncountably large number of times ... A black goose waddles past the door.  An individual hits it with an axe.  1. Given that the population of geese is uncountably large  and the size of the    confidence interval for the decision is undetermined  under what conditions    could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese    be made   2. If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed  is it not a valid question     to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably largenumber of my articles   Could Jim mean that because I  axed  his articles but not Weiss articles  he wants to conclude inductively ...Well  I cant see where he is going with this.But I can help him with his induction.  Ive written roughly 80articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions withFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists  where I take the position thatthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Merittwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments  a straw manargument earlier  and taking quotes out of context more recently. Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern   Think harder.  Run itthrough your induction engine and see what pops out.  dj

How to see characterset from wchar_t,"Nntp Posting Host  emuDistribution  compOrganization  Yokogawa Electric Corporation  Tokyo  JapanLines  137We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5s i18nfacility. As you know  there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MITs X11R5 release    Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkituses Xsi.Our toolkit manages each characters size based on our own font management system.In order to do that  the wchar_t typed character strings must be decomposedto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed  for example  is given  each element of the wchar_tarray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layoutand application environments locale. In this case if the locale is japanese each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859 1  jisx0208 or so.We need a function to do this. The function must check how many charactersfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably  usedXsis internal functions to construct that function. The following is thesource code of that function decomposeCharacterSet  .  I18N.h   This may look like C code  but it is really     C          Id  I18N.h v 1.1 1992 01 21 12 05 24 iima Exp iima   ifndef _I18N_H define _I18N_H include  X11 Xlib.h extern int decomposeCharacterSet const wchar_t  wc_str 	   IN   				 int wc_len 		   IN   				 char  buf 		   OUT   				 int  buflen 		   IN OUT   				 int  scanned_len 	   OUT   				 char   charset  	   OUT   extern XmString wcharToXmString const wchar_t  wc_str  extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar const wchar_t wc   endif    _I18N_H     I18N.cc    Id  I18N.cc v 1.1 1992 01 21 12 05 05 iima Exp      include  stdlib.h  include  X11 Xlibint.h  include  Xm Xm.h  include  I18N.h extern  C    include  X11 wchar.h  define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid include  Xlocaleint.h  undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset undef _Xmbfscs undef _Xmbctidtocsid    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XLocale  const wchar_t   int 					 char   int   int   int       extern Charset  _Xmbfscs XLocale  _CSID      extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid XLocale  _CSID    int decomposeCharacterSet const wchar_t  wc_str    IN   			  int wc_len 		   IN   			  char  buf 		   OUT   			  int  buf_len 		   IN OUT   			  int  scanned_len 	   OUT   			  char   charset 	   OUT        XLocale xlocale   _XFallBackConvert       int ctid     int status     Charset  xcharset         status   _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset xlocale  wc_str  wc_len  buf 				       buf_len  scanned_len   ctid      if  status    Success   	xcharset   _Xmbfscs xlocale  _Xmbctidtocsid xlocale  ctid   	 charset    xcharset    xcharset  cs_name   NULL          else	 charset   NULL     return status                  An included file above   Xlocaleint.h   is also Xsi internal and we copiedthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application onour HP machine with its OS version of HP UX9.01.When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing     _Xmbctidtocsid  code     _Xmbfscs  code     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset  code     _XFallBackConvert  code We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation untilHP UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was thatbecause HP did not release HPs X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to know how HPs R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsis popularity and used its internal functions. The HPs linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.We observe from HPs libX11.a  they used some Ximp implementation but we arenot sure if they used MITs vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp andtherefore  finding just counter part functions in MITs Ximp for Xsi does notseem to lead us a solution.My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function likedecomposeCharacterset   listed above. Is there any function to checkcharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales If it is a public function  that is perfect but even if it is not  wewant to use any internal functions in HPs X11R5 as we did for MITs R5.In order to render a wchar_t type string  there must be some machineryto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected forthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HPs X11R5 source files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this areaeven if it is not HPs implementation.Thank you.

Lundby  writes  As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question  WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD   I must assume that my wifes answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.I dont mean to be disrespectful to your concerns  but it seems to me that youre getting all wound up in a non issue.  As many knowledgeable people have pointed out  msg is a naturally occurring substance in a lot  if not most  foods.  When food manufacturers add it to a preparation  they do so because its a known flavor enhancer. Your wifes theory  that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite  may well be true.  But I dont believe its ALWAYS the reason its added.  People are  largely  for the most part  in charge of their own appetites.  childrens and my parents  seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference  but  some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions  for the net  are  Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food   Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances   Is MSG put in  pet food  You dont know much about cats  do you  Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself   you will never  understand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.  I also suspect  though its been a while since Ive checked ingredients on commercial cat food  that there are much more stringent requirements on pet food additives than human.  See  the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence to look out after their own interests.  Barbara  wondering how her cat would take care of  her

Anyone know what this is    That is it     Thanks a heap.     AlanWindows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1  it does not run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS  with  Billy Gates assures us  true multi tasking multithreading  meets DOD security specs  will run win3.1 programs as well as DOS programs  has multi processor support  and isprimarily a Server program.  Its overhead is too high for it to beeconomical for most users.	Speaking of overhead  it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  It iwll run with 12  but thats like running OS 2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And thats just to run it.  Also  I have heard that the system files take up 30 50 Megs  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig   The SKD is distributed on CD ROM.Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is  like NT  a true OS with thrue multitasking and multithreading  but has much smaller hardware requirements  and does not meet DOD security specs  but thats okay since it will probably be more of a client OS .  there are a few otehr differences  but those are the main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro oft are in intense competition  so it is said.  However  I think a different relationship will arise  NT will be the server   N etowrk  T echonology   Chicogo will be the client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OSs to work together  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT  think of it that way  anyway .   Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS  so dontscorn the concept. 	Anyway  dont expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be released next year  read  see it in 95   so I expect that Chicogo wont be out til 96.

In article  1993Apr15.024246.8076 Virginia.EDU  ejv2j Virginia.EDU   Erik Velapoldi   writes   This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway.  Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to  throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass.  Four or five  cars were hit.  There were several serious injuries  and sadly  a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck   in the head by one of the larger rocks.  I dont recall if she   made it  but I think she was comatose for a month or so and   doctors werent holding out hope that shed live.    What the hell is happening to this great country of ours   I  can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such  but  20 pound rocks     Has our society really stooped this low     Yes. Nobody is watching them.  If they get caught  there is no punishment at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping with a good sized belt  and then taken into some hospital to see first hand what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesnt happen any more.  That whipping would probably save the kids life by teaching him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would inevitably wind up dead early anyway.   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water  he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever so  gradually heat it  the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment industry and lack of religious  moral  and educational standards in our modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that we are about to be cooked  we may have woken up too late.    Erik velapold   Society  as we have known it  it coming apart at the seams  The basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is  No Big Deal . Kids see hundreds on murderous acts on TV  we can abort  children on demand  and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They dont care because the message they hear is  Life is Cheap    And the education system and the Religious Leaders arent doing much  about it  either.  With both parents working in this society  where is the stabilizing influence at home    Latchkey children are everywhere  And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to whatever violent hate promoting  music  and videos they like because no one is home to stop it.  This day and age  when there is about 100 times more things to learn than when I went to school  our answer to this increased knowledge is shorter school hours and more leisure time   I say keep the kids in school longer  feed them good food and teach them something  and when they get home  have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There is a very old and now forgotten proverb  a child left on his own will bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.

It seems pretty obvious that it will be made illegal if VERY LOUD NOISE isnot made about this IMMEDIATELY to Congress and the House  It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Dennings proposals are coming true.  If the government continues on this course  I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs for disk files and email  as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications  will be distributed only through the  underground .  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy. I dont know whats worse   the waste of money  or the fact that  in SPITEof all Clintons rhetoric to the contrary  this is a feeble attempt bya large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currentlyuseless jobs. Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government.This doesnt look very dietetic to me  As I said before in this group  drug dealing and terrorism both tend tobe international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts toregulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go toother countries to communicate their plans  and will still carry them outhere and or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem.They try to invent a new problem by saying we  need  encryption.

When I called the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probably needed replacing and that would cost me over  150   Ouch    Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem   One strange symptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shine a light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the wheel with my finger  it works fine that way but wont work if I turn off the light.

Since they arent fixed in position on theirstainless steel pins  you might try sliding them into a slightly differentposition. On my PowerBook 100  I can slide them almost completely out ofcontact with the trackball. In fact  one of the notes from sumex on fixingthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts theball  not the center cylindrical area.Ive done this with my PB100  and it does seem to improve the feel  butneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of ouroffices PB170s  and while there isnt as much latitude for movement  onecould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it mighthelp.I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. Ifyou can take it out  clean it with a mild soapy solution  or isopropyl alcohol. Also  be sure the ball is grease free.If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring  roll the ball and seeif it is actually causing the axle to spin. If all this still doesnt solve it  then maybe a new one is in order.    It could be an electrical connection  in which case replacement would benecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been thatdirt has been the normal problem  not an electrical malfunction.Hope this helps Murray    Murray M.

Losing your temper is not a Christian trait,Organization  Princeton UniversityLines  25In article  Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891 athos.rutgers.edu ruthless panix.com  Ruth Ditucci  writes    One of the tell tale signs fruits that give non christians away   is when their net replies are acrid  angry and sarcastic.  We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed  born again christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were  spiritually hungry.   Instead of answering questions with sweetness and sincerity  these chrisitan net warriors   flame  the queries. Although I certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness isunloving and ineffective  Im a little disturbed by the formulation thatill temper is not a Christian trait. It seems like a false argument tosay that anyone who displays trait X must not be a Christian. Couldwell be a sinning Christian  but a Christian nonetheless.Anger is human  and Christians arehuman  Christians get angry and defensive and react badly just likeeveryone else. Its not perfect righteousness but the effort of seekingrighteousness that marks a dedicated Christian. And one of the greatestgifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness formy failures. Expecting flawless behavior from self or others isntChristianity  its perfectionism.

Hell ,Organization  Florida State UniversityLines  26vic mmalt.guild.org  Vic Kulikauskas  writes   Our Moderator writes       Im inclined to read descriptions such as the lake of fire as     indicating annihilation.

I cant find the reference right now  but didnt C.S.Lewis speculate   somewhere that hell might be  the state of once having been a human   soul  Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasurefrom punishing people   The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil andhis angels.To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory withthe fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed  remember the Bibleteaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Theirjudgement is soon to come.Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theoryshould provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.

The Inimitable Rushdie,"Organization  Decision Support Inc.Lines  80NNTP Posting Host  dsi.dsinc.com References  deleted to move this to a new thread In article  114133 bu.edu  jaeger buphy.bu.edu  Gregg Jaeger  writes  In article  1phkf7INN86p dsi.dsinc.com  perry dsinc.com  Jim Perry  writes    Rushdie is  however  as I understand  a muslim.   The fact that hes a British citizen does not preclude his being muslim.   Rushdie was an atheist  to use local terminology  not to put words in  his mouth  at the time of writing TSV and at the time of the fatwa in  February 1989. ...   Well  if he was born muslim  I am fairly certain he was  then he _is_  muslim until he explicitly renounces Islam. So far as I know he has never explicitly renounced Islam  though he may have been in extreme doubt about the existence of God. Being muslim is a legal as well as intellectual issue  according to Islam. To put it as simply as possible   I am not a Muslim . ...  I do not accept the charge of apostacy  because I have never in my adult life affirmed any belief  and what one has not affirmed one can not be said to have apostasized from.  The Islam I know states clearly that there can be no coercion in matters of religion.  The many Muslims I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their faith  purely by virtue of birth   and that a person who freely chose not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death.     	    	    	    	Salman Rushdie   In Good Faith   1990 God  Satan  Paradise  and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth year  when I quite abruptly lost my faith.   ... and afterwards  to prove my new found atheism  I bought myself a rather tasteless ham sandwich  and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of the swine.  No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down.  ...  From that day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person.     	    	    	    	Salman Rushdie   In God We Trust   1985    I  think the Rushdie affair has discredited Islam more in my eyes than  Khomeini    I know there are fanatics and fringe elements in all  religions  but even apparently  moderate  Muslims have participated or  refused to distance themselves from the witch hunt against Rushdie.  Yes  I think this is true  but there Khomeneis motivations are quite irrelevant to the issue. The fact of the matter is that Rushdie made false statements  fiction  I know  but where is the line between fact and fiction   about the life of Mohammad. Only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of thenature of the novel could think such a thing.  Ill accept it reluctantly  from mobs in Pakistan  but not from you.  What ispresented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by thewildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on theactual Mohammad.  Whats worse  the novel doesnt present theMahound Mohammed character in any worse light than secular historiesof Islam  in particular  there is no  lewd  misrepresentation of hislife or that of his wives. That is why few people rush to his defense    hes considered an absolute fool for  his writings in _The Satanic Verses_. Dont hold back  hes considered an apostate and a blasphemer.However  its not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_  but forwhat people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what iscontained in that book.  I have yet to find  one single muslim  whohas convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initiallyclaimed to have done so  but none has shown more knowledge of the bookthan a superficial Newsweek story might impart  and all have madefactual misstatements about events in the book. If you wish to understand the reasons behind this as well has the origin of the concept of  the satanic verses   ...  see the Penguin paperback by Rafiq Zakariyah called _Mohammad and the Quran_.Ill keep an eye out for it.  I have a counter proposal  I suggestthat you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called _TheSatanic Verses_.  Perhaps then youll understand.

One Friday  one Saturday  and a good old Sunday doubleheader. What could be better   declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubsare challenging       Its pitching  its always been pitching that weve lacked   announcedRyne Sandberg.   If we can get by Brewer  then beat Carlton  Alexander  orBunning   preferrably 2 of the last three   well know we might be able towin.      Lord  I hope we pull it off.      The Phils scored once in the top of the first  Richie Ashburn singled  PeteRose followed with a hit  sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cutthe ball off in left center  and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks  who threwto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center  moving Pete Rose tothird.  Schmidt was walked   the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let himbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130 150 walks thisyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well  and he lashed a double into agap in right center.   Cool Papa  Bells speed allowed him to cut the ball offand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked  and Bob Boonegrounded out to second  ending the threat.        Teams are starting to realize that you dont have to pitch to Schmidt orTorrienti  and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure onKlein and Dick Allen  who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spellsRose at first   and its a credit to the Phillies that theyve been able tosustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.   So came theanalysis from Frank Chance.     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit  Thomas groundermoved him to second  and   after Sandberg made out   Billy Williams singledhome a run.  In the sixth  Ron Santo launched a two run homer to make it3 1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth  as Schmidt singled and Kleinsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox  but Dick Allen poppedout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right  but luckily for the Cubs Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish  hittingfor Boone  was walked  and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded intoa 1 2 3 double play  but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch hitter.  Desiring astrikeout  since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quickTrillo pinch running at third  Chance brought in Lee Smith  who induced apop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder  ending the inning.  TheCubs took the win  3 2  moving a game behind the Phillies.     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3 Finger Brown Saturday.  To getanother righthander in the lineup  Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlockplayed third.  Unfortunately  Brown allowed six doubles  and the Cub bullpenwas worn down even more  as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead againstLefty.  Madlock  batting sixth  had knocked two doubles of his own  drivinghome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs  and Cuyler addedanother  and the score was 8 6  Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpenhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth  as the Cubs grabbed 3 moreruns to ice an 11 7 triumph.     Sundays twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at onepoint  including a rare outside the park home run in the second game  offRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest  4 2  butthe Cubs captured the second one 5 4  with Waddell gaining the win.  BruceSutter tossed two innings for the save  though he allowed one run in theeighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders  and wouldconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.                                                                        Montreal at St. Louis August 3 6   3 way tie for 1st     Dennis Martinez is on a roll  and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.The Expos have a wide variety of hitters  and   while they arent among theall time greats  they are getting the job done.  After winning their firstfirst two games  they suddenly found themselves only 2 1 2 games out offirst in this wacky season.     Martinez triumphed 5 3 on Friday  and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3 2Saturday.  However  the Cardinals refused to give up  winning 6 2 on Sunday.The Cards captured Mondays game  too  as Steve Carlton outdueled SteveRogers 3 2.   Were really good against ground ball pitchers because of ourteam speed   remarked Lou Brock.   I dont see why we cant win thisdivision.      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two thirds ofthe way through the season  there is a 3 way tie for first.                                                                        New York at Pittsburgh August 3 6   3 straight 3 2 wins for Bucs now 2 back   but in 4th      When your team is in a slump like we are  the worst thing is to play in apitchers park like this   spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  KeithHernandez added that  their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra 6 7 wins.   The Pirates have made only26 errors all season  6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tendto be around 50 for the best defensive All Time teams.     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5 2 Friday  and Candelaria outshoneSeaver 3 2 Saturday  in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  WhenNolan Ryan and two relivers 6 hit the Mets in another 3 2 win Sunday  thePirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  BertBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessedfantastic stuff  and the only runs scored through eight innings were on homeruns   a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two run blast by RalphKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in thetop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco  working his second inning  after MookieWilson pinch ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner onfirst  Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch hit.  The Pirates countered with KentTekulve  placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds inleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcingStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner  preventing thePirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulveallowed a hit  but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the rightfield line  ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers  who enteredto pitch the eighth  and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deepcenter  running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the parkhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3 2 wins and had moved to within 2 games of first place  with seven weeks to go.                                                                       San Francisco at Boswaukta August 3 5       Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule  as the Giantsmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some startingpitching that just wouldnt tire.  In fact  reported manager John McGraw  once this rough part of the schedule is over  maybe as early as this comingweek  we may shift to a 4 man rotation again for a little while.      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday  beating Lew Burdette andthe Braves 4 1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschelfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves park had been a homerhaven  but this took the cake  as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16 13.Willie Mays had three homers  Willie McCovey  Eddie Matthews  and DonBaylor had two  and Hank Aaron  Ernie Lombardi  Biz Mackey  and Mel Ott hadone each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sundaysdoubleheader  putting them on a pace for 223  which would be 4 short of theNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the 61 Yankees pace.They had allowed over 120  though.  Vida Blue actually got the win afterretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth  butfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.     In the doubleheader  the Braves Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in thefirst game  but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as theBraves won  4 3.  The Giants took the second game  however  by a 6 2 score.The homer by Aaron was a magical  150 by the Braves  however  they fell tothree game below .500  making a comeback extremely unlikely.                                                                        San Diego at Cincinnati Aug. 3 5    Randy Jones faced EwellBlackwell in the first of this 3 game series  and the Padres felt rathergood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game  thetrade looked even better.  McGriffs batting average was even rising.  Ofcourse  the bench was very poor  and Joe Gordon was only adequate in theoutfield  but these were minor problems  since the pitching was holding up.     Jones pitched a good game Friday  and won 6 3.  McGriff launched twohome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and RayNarleski Saturday  5 4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled SatchelPaige to a 3 3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game wasscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after10  and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was workinghis second scoreless inning  when Dave Winfield doubled with one out andJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home and the Padres gamed a 5 3 win.  The three game sweep had pulled theGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it  the highlyemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.                                                                        Brookangeles at Houston August 3 5       Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in thewide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill inthe first game  opposite Don Drysdale.   Normally   Drysdale remarked   Iwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I cant affordto with this team  though  we have to get our own runners going  we cantafford to let the Astros beat us.   He then winked and said   Well  maybeDavis will get decked once.      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six     isprimarily why he would be decked  but it should be understood that hiscurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team isa little better  but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still  Carl Furillo isthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend  as he threwtwo runners out trying for inside the park homers.  For those unaware ofthe nastness of the Astros park  they have a 23 foot high gray wall allaround the outfield  balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  Thefoul poles are 355 feet from home plate  but the alleys are 400 feet away with center field at 420 feet.   Its as if some three year old threw atantrum and told his playmates  If I cant hit home runs  nobody will hithome runs   remarked Roy Campanella.     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday  but the Astros decided to revitalizethe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before  for tonight  anyway Davis  Jim Wynn  and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via theBaltimore chop  Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded witha two run double  but Wynn   playing first for Davis   popped up  and theAstros didnt score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth toerase a 3 2 deficit  and the Astros wound up winning 6 4.  They threatenedto do even better the next game  as Tommy John would be their opponent.Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop   he explained.      How can we do that   Pee Wee Reese wondered.      Theyre going to be beating the ball down  so weve got to be ready tothrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt  but Iwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  Well go witha shallow infield almost the whole time.      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eightinnings  but the Astros got three  two of them scored when Bill Doranpushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second andthird.  3 2 Astros was the final  with Dave Smith earning another save.  TheDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday  as NolanRyan walked five  three of whom scored in a 4 1 Dodger win.  FernandoValenzuela lost the second game 4 2 to Don Sutton  however  as the Dodgersthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      Were mostly a power team   remarked Ron Cey.   Jackie and  when heplays  Maury Wills are our only real speed demons  though a couple otherplays can do it now and then.  Were sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  Iguess thats why theyre so successful there.   Indeed  it seems thatbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The Strosswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts  giving them 230 on the season.

National Sales Tax  The Movie,Organization  University of Toronto Chemistry DepartmentLines  27In article  C5M2F9.GEB news.iastate.edu  atboyken iastate.edu  Aaron T Boyken  writes   If the VAT will be done in the same way that state and local sales  taxes are done  nothing will be on the sticker.  The cleark ringing up your purchase  gum  gas  car  etc.  will hit a button to add  another 5  on top of the state and local sales taxes  and that wont include any of the VAT from previous levels of sales . There is no need to include the VAT from previous levels becausethe VAT is a  difference  tax...if the VAT is X   than the amountof tax the government receives through all the levels is X  ofthe purchase price of the end consumer.  At the intervening levels only the difference between the VAT paid out and the VAT receivedis remitted to the government. Heres a question   what if  instead of a true VAT  the federal  government imposed a sales tax of say 2 3    The tax would only be paid on retail sales  thus not building up at all levels of production costs that are just passed on to consumers anyway   and would only go to reducing the deficit.   I know that this  would never happen  but it seems a lot more palettable than a VAT .A VAT is infinitely preferable to a retail sails tax...Gerald

Theory of one way hash functions  distinctions of terms. MD4 and MD5. Snefru.X Last Updated  1993 04 16Archive name  cryptography faq part07Last modified  1993 4 15FAQ for sci.crypt  part 7  Digital Signatures and Hash FunctionsThis is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts aremostly independent  but you should read the first part before the rest.We dont have the time to send out missing parts by mail  so dont ask.Notes such as    KAH67  refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as  pub usenet news.answers cryptography faq part xx .  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt  sci.answers  and news.answersevery 21 days.Contents   What is a one way hash function   What is the difference between public  private  secret  shared  etc.   What are MD4 and MD5   What is Snefru   What is a one way hash function   A typical one way hash function takes a variable length message and  produces a fixed length hash. Given the hash it is computationally  impossible to find a message with that hash  in fact one cant  determine any usable information about a message with that hash  not  even a single bit. For some one way hash functions its also  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the  same hash.  A one way hash function can be private or public  just like an  encryption function. Heres one application of a public one way hash  function  like MD5 or Snefru. Most public key signature systems are  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user  is willing to wait. Solution  Compute the one way hash of the message   and sign the hash  which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the  signature can do the same thing.  Another name for one way hash function is message digest function.  What is the difference between public  private  secret  shared  etc.   There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which  isnt published  we call it a private algorithm  otherwise we call it  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption  functions D  so that D E M     M for any message M. We also have  hashing functions H and verification functions V  such that V M X    1  if and only if X   H M .  A public key cryptosystem has public encryption and private  decryption. Checksums  such as the application mentioned in the  previous question  have public hashing and public verification.  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public  verification  only one person can produce the hash for a message   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.  Obviously  when an algorithm depends on a private key  its meant to  be unusable by anyone who doesnt have the key. Theres no real  difference between a   shared key and a private key  a shared key  isnt published  so its private. If you encrypt data for a friend  rather than   for your eyes only  are you suddenly doing    shared key encryption rather than private key encryption  No.  What are MD4 and MD5   MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321  see part 10 . Code is  available from  FTPMD .  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a  though some  people refer to it as MD5.  What is Snefru   Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph  Merkle. Snefru 8 is an 8 round function  the newest in the family.  Definitions appear in Merkles paper  ME91a . Code is available from   FTPSF .

Thats not all that Kratz doesnt know.   Hell  a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing  that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is  that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety.  Now we know that Kratz doesnt understand what a safety is supposed to do.   He also confuses  things he can see  with  things that exist   Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the outside.  Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to do.  Its basic purpose  not to let the gun fire until youre ready.  Christ  Ive known that since Ihad my first Crosman air gun.  You dont know me so dont make assumptionsabout what I know and dont know.  I do know that the Glock has multiplesafties from reports  looking at them at a gun shop  and friends who own one. A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS thats what the user wants.  With Glocks  one says  I want the gun to go off  by pulling the trigger.  If the safeties it has make that work  it has a  real  safety  no matter what Kratz thinks.   andy   From the things I have read heard Glocks are always knocked because of thetrigger safety.  They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly.  Everyarticle that I have read cant be wrong about the damn thing.  And dont askme to quote my sources because I dont keep a ton of gun magazines and orrec.guns articles laying around.  Boy  you cant make a simple statement onhere without someone getting right on your ass.  No wonder why there are somany problems in the world.  Everyone takes everything just a little tooseriously.  By the way   Im not going to reply to any of this stuff anymore assomeone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to r.g And yes I know that I had something to do with that .Jason

helmets,X AltNet ID  211353Lines  29  Grf. Dropped my Shoei RF 200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock it onto its centerstand  chipped the heck out of the paint on it...  So I cheerfully spent  .59 on a bottle of testors model paint and repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes.  Then  while it was drying  I realized that I was out of smokes and that my cage is not currently running... So I  had to  take my bike down to the store. Not wanting to mess up my paint job  I said  Well  heck. I can just use my old helmet .... this is your standard el cheapie openface...    I didnt notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei  but switching back was really bad...   1  Doesnt fit worth a damn  too wide in the sides  too short front to back... 2  With a faceplate  its still bloody windy... with the shoei  I normally ignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish... with this one  taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind.      The question for the day is re  passenger helmets  if you dont know for certain whos gonna ride with you  like say you meet them at a .... church meeting  yeah  thats the ticket ... What are some guidelines  Should I just pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet  XL   or should I maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely passenger

The good players have  always  been ready for the majors early.  How many HOFers were  not  contributing major leaguers by the time they were 22   That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPNs piece aboutprospects and the relationship between age  career length  MVPs and Hall ofFame members  It was part of their preseason special. Basically  they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances  or ABs  by the time theywere 24  and noticed some interesting things.   For starters  they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs inthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented themajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker  though  was thatthey actually did some number crunching and found that such players careerslasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance andproduced over twice the raw totals  HRs  etc  of the other players. The firstgroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA  and blew awaythe second group in such categories as HRs  2Bs  RBIs  etc.   It was the most impressive thing Ive seen on ESPN in recent memory.

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive  Seagate 1239A   andwhat I would say is a standard  not special  no cache I believe  IDE controllercard on my ISA 486 50.Im currently thinking about adding another HD  in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.And Im thinking hard  you should hear those gears a grinding in my head about buying a SCSI drive  SCSI for the future benefit .  I believe Im gettingsomething like 890Kb sec transfer right now  according to NU .How would thisnumber compare if I bought the state of the art SCSI card for my ISA PC  andthe state of the art SCSI hard drive  the wailing est system I could hope for  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other  but what wouldYOU want to use on your ISA system  And how much would it cost Along those lines  what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HDs if Iwere to buy the top of the line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb  15ms HD And how much would it cost I actually have a PAS 16  and could  what a waste I guess it would be...  hookup a SCSI HD through its SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb sec.Actually  I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now  andown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS 16 SCSI port .  Is this SCSI port aSCSI 2 port   How could I tell   Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI 2   Are all SCSIHDs SCSI 2 Thanks for any comments.Randy

Quadra SCSI Problems   ,Keywords  Quadra SCSI APSLines  29Reply To  jim jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov  Jim Jagielski Organization  NASA Goddard Space Flight Centertzs stein2.u.washington.edu  Tim Smith  writes    ATTENTION  Mac Quadra owners  Many storage industry experts have   concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating   from the standard SCSI specification. This results in silent corruption   of data when used with some devices  including ultra modern devices.   Although I will not name the devices  since it is not their fault  an   example would be a Sony 3.5 inch MO  without the special  Mac compatible    firmware installed. One solution  sometimes  is to disable  blind writes  This doesnt sound right to me.  Dont Quadras use the 53C96   If so  the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  Thats all handled by the chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96.  That  however  should only really hurt synchronous transfer  which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager. Furthermore  disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380  which is a much lower level SCSI chip  the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396  the handshake is entirely handled by the chip.The docs say that its a SCSI Manager bug  if this changes things at all...       Jim Jagielski                   And hes gonna stiff me.

On hook   LED on       Off hook   LED off.       Would this work  If anyone tries tried it  please let me know.           Aye  theres the rub    if you draw enough current to light an LED  the      equipment at the phone company will think youve gone off hook.      In the on hook state youre not supposed to draw current.        Which means you should just use your Digital VoltMeter. You can use an    old VOM but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think    theres something wrong with the cable.          Look Guys  whats the problem here   If you want a light that goes on when    the phone is  Off  hook  all you need it to run it in  series  with the    line  as I mentioned in my previous post.  If you want a light that goes on    when the phone is  on  hook  all you need is a voltage threshold detector.  If youre going to do the series Diode thing  which is the easiest   just make sure that the LED can take the current  I cant recall it off hand  but its something like 100mA or more  Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC   20Hz that is forced on ringand tip when the phones supposed to ring   Even with a simple zenerand LED setup  you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whateverscheme you use  make sure youve got at least 200V rated components on the frontend.Also remember that  if Im not mistaken  the phone line is a 600ohmequivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so getsdropped across that 600ohms.  Thats fine until youre down to roughly12V  when Ma Bell considers it to be off hook.  But dropping it thatfar down is probably a big no no.The easiest implementation to accomplish the above      tip                                                      rectifier  resistor                            diode                                                                V                                     zener                  resistor                                                                                                                                            V   LED                                                                                                   ring                                       This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it  but youget the idea.

Well they obviously arent getting anywhere with their current methodsof asking  not very peaceful Id say .BM  Think of 10 or 20 years down the line    both of the newly independent BM  countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM  the other out.   These people will be neighbors  would it not be better BM  to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik 	   Dont get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to thehenrik 	   conflict. But until Azeris realize that  the Armenians inhenrik 	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.I dont know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.Peace isnt whats happening right now  furthermore whats happeningright now isnt condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights raving about how right the Armenian position is and Im suretherell be others whod be happy to talk to you by arguing the otherside.  If entrenched positions lead to war  and if people want peacethan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isntstrong enough to exercise the we think were right  and we have the bombs  so well do whatever we want  so there... style of foreign relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps  and give one sidedatrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course this being just USENET.  The people in power shouldnt be so childish.BM  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora  keep in mind that what strikesBM  your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM  their blood and future. henrik 	   Again  you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intensionhenrik 	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKHhenrik 	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.Azeris would disagree with you on this  and the maps Ive seen supportwhat theyd be saying.  It doesnt seem likely that a solution will bereached in this manner.  BM  Its easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The ArmeniansBM  in Armenia and N K will be there  with the same people you seem to hate BM  as their neighbors  for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner theres peace inBM  the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  Id push forBM  compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps lock and spreadingBM  inflammatory half truths.henrik    It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutelyhenrik    for it. It didnt look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me that if you can spew mis information about a boogey man  you can alsotalk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair henrik  But  in the meantime  if you do not take care of yourself henrik  you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915 20 ofhenrik  The Armenian Massacres.You dont realize I can say the same thing about The Turkish Massacres.Yes  boys and girls  lets always talk about how bad and nasty things were.Lets do that so were overwhelmed by anger  and lets do that so ourkids will also be hateful.  Sounds crazy doesnt it   Dont do it then.BM"

How do  we  know that they were gang members and not undercover cops or even law abiding menacing minorities.  BTW   Why the sneer quotes   We  know because the area that the gun shop shooting range is in is right onthe border of the west side of Chicago.  That is a gang infested area.  Thereare many  many bad things going on in that area.  Also  I have several friendsthat live very close to that area who have had problems with some of thesefolks.  By the way  where did I say that they were minorities   Do you thinkthat only minorities have gangs   Not so.  As far as the quotes are concernedit was totally obvious that they werent just practicing for marksmanship.  Idont know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship bytaking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  Ifyou would have been there Andy it wouldve been obvious to you too.  Of courseit might not have been.  Who knows.  All I do know is that I was there  I livehere and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough itbecomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors  gang signs  etc.  One lastthing.  My sister is a social worker.  She makes it her point to find thesethings out  gang signs  colors  etc  because it is in her best interest to doso.  She is nice enough to let me know these things so I can watch out formyself as I live right on the border of the west side of the city. Enough said.Jason

I orderedthe one without ethernet  but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.He wanted to know if that would be  alright with me      They mustbe backlogged on Centri w out ethernet so theyre just shipping themwith   	Anyway  Im very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  Being nosy  I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the firsttime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected must have come loose in shipping .  No big deal  but I would have beenpissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldnt come up 	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  Iveheard apple will exchange it if you complain  so I might try to getit swapped.	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power on off.  Thiswasnt mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also  the locationof the reset interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control forthese functions was much more convenient.	Oh  and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power up.Ive seen this mentioned by others  so it must be a...feature...	Anyway  above all  its fast.

Atlanta Hockey Hell  ,Organization  Post Office  Carnegie Mellon  Pittsburgh  PALines  23NNTP Posting Host  po4.andrew.cmu.eduWell  its not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at thelocal ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playingDavid Brinkley at 12 30 instead of an earlier time slot. I donteven understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people wouldnot watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game  Andif they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game  would it hurt to playDavid Brinkley at its regular time  They dont have any decent programmingbefore noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on theirmachine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why theypremepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs  he seemed a bitconfused. When I explained a bit more in detail  he then said thats uptoto our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel  I understand that thesports dept is not responsible for this preemption. BUt I cant understandhow someone in the sports dept. cant even recognise the name of playoffsshown on the very same station he works for.Anyway  I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.I urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB 2 and ask them not to do thesame thing for the next 4 weeks.

So who cares which PLAYER gets credited  as long as the TEAM gets more runs   If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI  but  doesnt score them all himself  who cares Amusing  isnt it   Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball isa  team  game  combining efforts from every player for the win.Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4 3 in the bottomof the 13th.  Who won the game  Clemens pitched a strong nine     innings  allowing only two runs. Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings  though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so. Quantrill pitched a couple of innings  gave up the go ahead run  and got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of the inning.Looks like a team effort to me   Yet only Quantrill got credit forthe win.How about the offense  Dawson and Vaughn hit  I think  HRs early in the game.  Without either one  the Sox would have lost in nine. Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. Zupcic pinch ran for Quintana  providing the speed to go from first to third when... Cooper ripped a  second  single in the inning. Melvin avoided the DP  getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of a help  but it was something. Scrub Richardson then hit a double  scoring the speedy Cooper all the way from first    Hills lack of defense helped. Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs  Melvin and Richardson werecredited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintanas hitthat set up the whole inning   And did Melvin really contribute asmuch as Richardson Furthermore  people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant thanruns.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper   Cooper provided thegame winning baserunner  and moved the tying run to third base withonly one out Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  Youcan argue that OBP and SLG dont show you who came through in theclutch  but R RBI dont do any better.  At least OBP and SLG dont claim  to try to tell you that.Heres to the Red Sox who contributed to last nights victory.All 20 of them  Valentine

Last resort   Mail mathew mantis.co.uk  or post an article to the   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this   if youve tried the above methods and theyve failed  its not nice to   clutter the newsgroup or peoples mailboxes with requests for files.   its better than posting without reading the FAQ  though   For instance    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who dont have    FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.mathewÿ
Experience opinions sought  diesel engines,Article I.D.  sail.13600Organization  Tektronix  Inc.  Beaverton   OR.Lines  42In article  91321 hydra.gatech.EDU  jkg jmp.com writes  Apologies if this is a FAQ  is there a FAQ posting for this group  I am an infrequent reader of rec.autos  so I cant remember .  I am in the market for a used Chevy Suburban  and have observed that prices for models with diesel engines run about  1000 2000 less than comparable models with a gas engine.  There has to be a reason for this. Yes  there is   consumer confusion.  In the early 80s with thefuel crisis  etc.  everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuelwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileagethan comparable gasoline engines.  So  GM decided to conver their350 gas engine into a diesel engine  I think was a 5.7 liter .  Bigmistake.  The engine was not redesigned  but converted.  The enginecould not handle the higher compression  etc.  Lots of problems withthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer   DON T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.Ask yourself this question    if your livelihood depended on driving LOTS of it  would you use a dependable or undependable  but cheaperin the short run  vehicle   What do Greyhound busses have in them Trailer Trucks   Even Train Locomotives   Are these gasoline engines No  they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a500 000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.I own an  82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.Just keeps going.  It was more expensive  when new  than the gasolineengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt  they are expensive.  In a gas 350engine  you will pay about  1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about 2000.  But then again  the diesel engine lasts about twice as longand gets about 50  better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline enginecosts about  100 to rebuild  or less .  A rebuild of the fuel injectionpump on a diesel will cost about  500  or more .  But then again you never need a tune up.If youre looking at a rebuilt 6.2L  Id say you got a great deal.Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.Good luck.

Good Jewish Arguments,Lines  90kwfinken pooh.harpo.uccs.edu  Kevin W. Finkenbinder   wrote  scott born.phys.virginia.edu wrote       intro deleted...              1  Jesus wasnt really descended from David as the Messiah was supposed   to have been. Joseph was  but Christians say that Joseph wasnt related to   Jesus truthfully.          If you look at the geneology of Christ in Luke 3 and the one in Matthew 1 you will notice that they trace different lines back to David. I have been told that one traces Marys line back to David and the other traces Josephs line back to David.   Both of them go beyond David in history   Acording to some of my Jewish friends   Jewishness  is passed to a child by the mother and the legal rights of  Jewishness  are passed through the father.  If it is true that one of these geneologies is Marys  then Christs bloodline is from David through His mother.  This also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of David as according to at least Roman law  and possibly Mosaic law as well  but I am not sure  Joseph was Christs LEGAL FATHER.The argument for Lukes genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. Accordingto Luke 3 23   And when he began his ministry  Jesus himself was about    thirty years of age  being supposedly the son of Joseph    the son of Eli Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned  there are two possibleinterpretations  either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph  the sonof Eli  was her Father and just happened to have the name as the manto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping atstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had nointention of tracing Marys genealogy  in which case he would havenamed her  but that he traces her husbands  from Davids son Nathan.The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from Davidsson  Solomon  to Joseph.  Matthew 1 16 reads    And to Jacob was born Joseph  the husband of Mary  by whom was born   Jesus  who is called Christ. There are two apparent problems.  The first is  how to reconcile thetwo paternal genealogies   which diverge with the sons of David Solomon and Nathan.  The second is  why is any genealogy of Josephrelavent at all  if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph wasnot Jesuss physical father  then the original poster is quitecorrect  that claims for Jesuss messianic heritage are not based ontruth but only on appearances  whatever Jesuss divine nature was.The second problem is easy  in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was notinvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However  a HolySpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is alsocapable of employing the physical agency of Josephs seed in thiswork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its losssolely in terms of a physical act  whereas it is really a matter ofpurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is thatneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them  theyhad not  known each other .  Thus the first gospels dedication ofhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevantto Jesus  the Virgin birth not  withstanding.To the first question there is an answer that creates  to begin with  moreproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely differentsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child  and the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty yearslater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered hisexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then convergewith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive hisresolution from biblical study or speculation  or from other externaldocuments  and the discussion of  how this could be  might bring us beyondthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case  thedetails are described in Steiners  The Spiritual Guidance of the Human Being and of Humanity    The Gospel of St. Luke   and  The Gospel of St.Matthew . Whether or not Rudolf Steiners methods and explanation are acceptedas valid  at least this interpretation resolves the apparentcontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.As for the passing of ones Jewishness through the mother  this wasnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or MarysJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternalline of descent from David  the king.Gerry Palo  73237.2006 compuserve.com

Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show  ABC Radio Network  October 27  1992. NLNS   Believe it or not  I was planning this comparative review of Mein Kampf and Limbaughs transcribed rant  The Way Things Ought to Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual  Sahls was independent and sharp as a scalpel.	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Morts. At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise  everyone Id mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery.	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills  which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions  in fact  Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million  almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election . Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult  and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt.	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. Hitlers example is when  on page 5  he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter  he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg  being caught in the act  in 1923  was  betrayed to France by a representative of his government  when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.	In fact  the governments of both the Reich and Prussia  as well as the Vatican  actively intervened to save him from execution  and almost succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that  in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.  Of course  its not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individuals will thats unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.	Of course  one would assume that  by comparing the two books  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf  Hitler was just four months out of prison  June  1925   and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen million followers. Limbaugh  on the other hand  came up with his book after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.	Thus  the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaughs daily three hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf  the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume  and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will  a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also  the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany  since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. Today  on the other hand  Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.	But  as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night  some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda.  And remember  Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days. 	Mort might not know exactly who Rushs equivalent of Rodolf Hess is  the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin  the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaughs partner in EFM Media  the radio programs production company . But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show  having hosted them in New York  Washington and Los Angeles. He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did  its almost worthy of a RICO indictment.	On questions of social issues  there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitlers venom. For example On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society	Hitler   Out of the host of sometimes millions of people  who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth  partly perhaps understand it  one man  authors emphasis  must step forward in order to form  with apodeictic force  out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses  granite principles  and to take up the fight for their sole correctness  until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises   page 577 .	Limbaugh   Who needs the media when theyve got me  ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ...  the phrase  with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even   denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years  but Im convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking  kicking and screaming all the way.   pages 266  21  299 and 273  respectively. On Religion as the Basis of a Nation	Hitler   In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Paradise.   Page 581. 	Limbaugh   America was founded as a Judeo Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since    pages 274 5. On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse	Hitler   The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses  vaudevilles and theatres  and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre  art  literature  movies  the press  billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture.   pages 346 and 348. 	Limbaugh   Today  Hollywood is in trouble. The reason  is  that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family  heterosexuality and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.   page 254. On the News Meida	Hitler   The activity of the so called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... its task is only to break the peoples folkish and national spine  in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters  the Jews.   Page 331. 	Limbaugh   Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During the Gulf war  CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw  said  CNN is a global network. We cant take sides. Cant take sides               ... If they dont realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation  they are hopelessly misguided and  may I suggest  flirting with megalomania.   pages 270 and 268.              	To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible  but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.	After putting these books down  there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. In the 1920s  Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them  in turn  it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing  distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans  in turn  it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12 year nightmare of the Reagan Bush era comes to an end  hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America.	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler  it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845  Madison  WI 53701 0845   608  255 4460.    30    "

fillibuster,Organization  University of Tennessee Division of Continuing EducationLines  132In article  C5JpL7.5Cz dscomsa.desy.de  hallam dscomsa.desy.de  Phill Hallam Baker  writes   In article  1993Apr12.002302.5262 martha.utcc.utk.edu   PA146008 utkvm1.utk.edu  David Veal  writes      Come to that under the original plan there wasnt meant to be anything    much for the federal government to do except keep the British out.             Thats also untrue  but at least were wandering a little closer   toward reality.  That the Articles of Confederation fell apart is enough   proof it was there for just a tad bit more.  Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them.        There are a couple of ways to look at them.  One is   We wantyou to support this Constitution  so well say anything that we thinkwill appeal to you   or the more straightforward   This is why we thinkwhat weve suggested in this Constitution is a good idea.        You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.       Well  I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist  and probably the authoritarian extreme to Jeffersons democratic impules.But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinionson the government if we dont consider what they wrote about thegovernment        And is writing in support of something automatically  propoganda to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying whatthey dont believe     And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty    wide powers. Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock    set in.             I wasnt aware the House of Lords had  wide powers.   I was under the   impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons  and   certainly didnt have almost equal their powers.   The Senate is restricted   only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in  question.       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords  thanwed almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. In fact  they both were  because the British government had muchgreater power than did the American system .                 My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely   no reason to believe the Senate wasnt intended to make use of their    law making powers.  In fact  grid lock appears to have been designed   into the system  with the Senate being a more deliberative body to act   as a check on the more often elected House.  The system is meant to be slow to react  the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.       I disagree.  The system is not too slow  it was simply designed tohandle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washingtonput it  whose name I forget    Congress has become everybodys citycouncil.        Congress is more than capable of quick action  and has more thanenough power and time on its hands  if it confined itself to what itsoriginal jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specificallywanted to avoid.  Namely  a concentration of power.  It would seemthen that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of eitherHouse in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All youll get then isa system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make moresense to make more decisions at a local level.          On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be   some sort of rubber stamp for the House   Youll note that while the   Presidents veto may be over ridden  the House cant do anything about   a  veto  by the Senate.  The President veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation.        Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an  extraordinary manner. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.       I fail to see where any restrictions  implied or otherwise  wereplaced on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a meansto put a check on democratically popular but unwise  in the executivesopinion  policies.         There is no limit in the Constitution to the Presidents veto powerregarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the vetofor any number of reasons  most usually having something to do with theiragenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as  the  Presidentwho abused vetos. the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body  it is meant as a check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built into the constitution in favour of the status quo  60  of the representatives of the states is not a reasonable restriction.       Why is it not a reasonable restriction   Because 51 Senatorsis the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based   If 41 Senatorsfeel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isnt that  enough  to indicate theres a sufficient questionas to whether a law is a good idea or not to re evaluate it        Why one earth  should  51  be sufficient to enact a law whichcovers 250 million people in very  very diverse places and livingin radically different conditions   Why  shouldnt  a super majoritybe required        Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute powerto ignore the minority then the minority  will  be ignored.  I do notsee this as a positive thing.  And for all that Im sure the Republicansare looking for pork as much as the Democrats  theyve got some legitimateobjections to the legislation in question.

IDE vs SCSI,Organization  New Mexico State University  Las Cruces  NMLines  59Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  dante.nmsu.eduwlsmith valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca  Wayne Smith  writes   I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid  369 for it.  I  havent seen IDE drives cheaper. A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for  320.   thats 245 million bytes  or 234 mega bytes .  With the basic  20 interface  he gets close to 1 meg sec transfer on his 286 20.  Does your figure include a few hundred     for SCSI drivers Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI 1 for hard drives YES the  figure includes ahundred     for SCSI drivers   This is sloppy people and DUMB. But on that point  is it faster   This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.Ok once again with the SCSI spec list SCSI 1  with a SCSI 1 controler chip  synchronous range is indeed 0 5MB s asynchronous range is slower at 0 3MB s.SCSI 1  With a SCSI 2 controller chip   4 6MB s with 10MB s burst  8 bit  Note the INCREASE in SPEED  the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI 1 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.SCSI 2  8 bit SCSI 1 mode            4 6MB s with 10MB s burst for those who want SCSI 2 but dont want to pay for the 16 bit or 32 bit hardware or mess with the SCSI 2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI 1 devices with close to 8 bit SCSI 2 speeds SCSI 2  16 bit wide or fast mode    8 12MB s with 20MB s burstSCSI 2  32 bit wide AND fast       15 20MB s with 40MB s burstOn the other interfaces let DXB132 psuvm.psu.edu speak  IDE ranges from 0 8.3MB s.                          Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  Range 0 5MB s  ESDI is always 1.25MB s  although there are some non standard versions One problem is the inconsitant use of the term SCSI in articles and bypeople.  Its PROPER meaning is  The set of SCSI interfaces composed ofSCSI 1 AND SCSI 2 Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote  My comments in    PC Magazine April 27  1993 29  Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI  This is asynchronous SCSI 1 with a SCSI 1 chip  20  faster than IDE...  this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI 1 with a SCSI 2 chip AND 8 bit SCSI 2 To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read  asynchronous SCSI 1 with a SCSI 1 chip  Although asynchronous SCSI 1 is twice as fast as ESDI  one third the speed of IDE... or  asynchronous SCSI 1 with a SCSI 2 chip or 8 bit SCSI 2  Although SCSI 1 with a SCSI 2 chip and 8 bit SCSI 2 are eight times as fast asESDI  20  faster than IDE... NOTE the NONUSE of SCSI by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.SCSI 1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16 bit and 32 bit SCSI 2 drivers are VERY expansive  8 bit SCSI 2 can use SCSI 1 drivers with little speeddegridation the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.  If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI 1 or SCSI 2 or SCSI over all  SCSI 1 AND SCSI 2 IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

He had given up Chicagos coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power of a GM now increases the pressure on beleaguered Rangers GM Neil Smith.This will be an interesting combination to watch ... Keenan has beenpaid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach  but hisadvice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  A lot of bigplayer moves will happen     remember that Keenan got rid of DenisSavard.  The country club days are over ... 	  When Keenan left Chicago I couldnt help but think about  him as our coach  Smith said.   There was an indication he would  be taken off the market. I feared that and couldnt let that happen.If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offeredKeenan the big money to put up and shut up back in January  theRangers might not be heading for golf now ... 	Keenan  43  takes on a demoralized team that offers him a chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects    at the highest salary ever commanded by an NHL coach. The Rangers    owned by Gulf   Western    have bestowed upon Keenan an unprecedented  3 million  four year deal  	  Ive known Mike a long time  Messier said.   Weve won two Canada Cups together. Hes been to the finals three times. Maybe we miss just one more element to win the Stanley Cup. I dont think hes the same person he was 10 years ago or even five years ago. I think he has changed and bettered himself with experience.One of Keenans first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messierwill be the teams captain. 	The timing of the move gives the Rangers new coach 2 1 2 months to prepare for the NHL draft  June 26   and Neil Smith may  not back off the their trade happy pattern.By then  Smith might have some bargains on Keenans advice ... likemaybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi ...    gld                           Je me souviens                              Gary L.

While I dont mean to damn Henriks attempt to be helpful here  hes using a common misconception that should be corrected.     Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color quantization you see when you dont have enough bits.  It is the human eyes response to transitions or edges between intensities. The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on the brighter side and darker on the darker side.   AndreYeah  of course... The term mach banding was not the correct one  it shouldvebeen color quantization effect.

Evil smile on my face as Cubs Beat Braves,"Organization  University of Illinois at UrbanaLines  29Boy  hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to putdown Braves fans.  I mean  all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutiveworld series.  Also  being the Cubs fan that I am  I really have to hand it toall the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with thatinfernal cheer that they have.  However  I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  Theway I see it  either Im just too stupid to acknowledge it  or that observationwas just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans.   Anyway  about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubswould finish up last in their division.   Even behind Florida     Sheesh    These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respectivedivision.  Well   were ten games into the season and these people are a littleless vocal now.  I wonder why.Well  the way I see it  the East is up for grabs  and whoever wants it most isgoing to take it  with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to havegood batting and pitching  with Philly presently leading the pack.  But  I justhave to point out  if the Cubs do take the East  theyll do it without thebenefit of a competent manager.  However  and it pains me to say it  thepennant is going to go to the West.Just had to get that off my chest.						Docbembenefit of a compee"
Centris 650 to Decstation E net adapter,Organization  University of Toronto  Department of Industrial EngineeringLines  86 pnsf01dw smucs1.umassd.edu  Dennis J. Wilkinson  writes  Not necessarily a thrid party adapter  Apple does manufacture transceivers for thinWire and 10BaseT  twisted pair  cable media  as well as an AUI  Attachment Unit Interface  transciever. They run at   100 each. If you use thinWire or 10BaseT  youll probably also need terminators  Apples transceivers are self terminated  if I remember correctly  but I have no idea about DECs . The third party media adapters are usually cheaper  at least in Toronto  thanApples. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.gurman umbra.gsfc.nasa.gov  Joseph B. Gurman  writes      The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only  cant say for certain about the Models 125 and 133   so your best betThats not true. Only the DECstation 5000 200 comes with a Thinwire BNC  coaxial  Ethernet connector. The 5000 25  5000 133 and 5000 240all have a single 15 pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctlyremembered this because when got the 5000 200 first and I thought allof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and orderedDESTAs  DECs oversized version of an AUI to BNC adapter that MUST be usedwith a transciever cable  for the rest of the stations.My advise to the very original poster  Beverly   is  1  If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and wont add    machines to it EVER  go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going    for UTP  unshielded twisted pair  wiring requires a concentrator which    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.    As for Thicknet  its a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it    unless you have no choice  e.g. the two machines are two floors parts . 2  On the Mac side  you will need       one Thinwire media adapter  from Apple or third party .      MacX  make sure you get version 1.2  1.1.7 wont run on System 7.1 .      MacTCP  which comes with MacX  if you get MacX v1.2  you should be      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Dont use earlier versions on a Centris .      you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is      self terminated or not.      configure MacTCP to use  Ethernet . 3  On the DECstation side  you will need       for a Model 200  you will only need a T connector.      for Models 25  125  133  240  you will need an AUI to BNC adapter.      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       a 15 pin AUI male to a 15 pin AUI female cable .      get a 25ohm terminator.Your two machine network will look like this          T                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             DECstation                                        Centris     5000 200                                           650                              OR         T                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             DECstation                                        Centris5000 25 125 133 240                                     650                     25ohm terminator   T        T connector            Thinwire  RG58 coaxial cable             AUI to BNC  i.e. Thick to Thin  adapter            Thickwire media adapter  assuming self terminated         Andy   Andy Sun  andy ie.utoronto.ca           4 Taddle Creek Road  TorontoComputing Coordinator                   Ontario  Canada.

This attitude on the part of many theists  especially the vocal ones  is one reason for the hostility you sense. How do you like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of immature emotionalism i agree    if you are going to find out anything from people who dontshare your beliefs  do not attack them or condescend to them and hopeto get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind. I dont believe that atheists are generally any more  broken  than anybody else. Any cause and effect is likely to be the other way. There is an emotional price to pay for being different  hearing ones beliefs  or lack thereof  condemned  and ones motives and character attacked.well  you do believe in something  as i see it  even if it is a sortof  anti belief   no negative connotation meant  i mean simply thatyou believe that God _does not_ exist .  christians can also feel thatsense of  difference   however  when they are associated with  thoseweird televangelists who always talk about satan .  if youll excusethe cliched sound of this  everyone has to deal with his  herdifferences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheistcould be hard for you  being a christian is sometimes hard for me. I became an atheist when I got old enough to reason because there was just no good reason to believe the religion I had been taught. This was very painful because of the pressure I was placed under by my family and friends. I wanted to fit in  believe  and be accepted. I tried  but finally the cognitive dissonance was just too great.you should not have to repress how you feel    you should be able todiscuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learnfrom any belief  which can enrich your own    by asking myself thequestions that atheists may ask me  i can learn the answers and becomestronger in my faith.  if my faith cant support knowing the answersto those questions  it is weak and untrue.  I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves because Ive been there. Only in my case it was my rationality instead of sexuality which I was forced to try to repress.in some way the pressures were different  of course  because you chose  your beliefs    or are you saying that they were not yourchoice  but born of necessity    please  no flames about whether ornot gay people  choose  their lifestyle    thats elsewhere in thisnewsgroup   I must say that I wasnt hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends who didnt become atheists. I was just hurt differently.im not sure i understand this sentence    could you explain  moderator points out that many  most atheists arent  hostile   theyjust cease believiing in xiantiy  religion  True. Consider also that people like Pat Robertson and many of the Christian extremists in soc.religion.christianity naturally evoke hostility by their attacks on anyone who disagrees and their attempts to force their views on others. You are known by the company you keep. Christians trying to preach in alt.atheism should not be surprised by hostility.ouch  yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with anopen heart    including people of  our own camp  with whom wecompletely disagree.  by the same token  i believe that accusation andsuspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting ourreligion.  i have a different idea of mission  be what i am  achristian who is happy in her faith  and if others see that and wantto know about either the happiness or the religion  ill share what iknow without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at somepoint you just have to agree to disagree    acceptance of diversity not uniformity  is the way to sow peace....

THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                           April 16  1993                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYThe President today announced a new initiative that will bringthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.The initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and securetelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.For too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth  privacy andlaw enforcement  previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information  it also can be usedby terrorists  drug dealers  and other criminals.A state of the art microcircuit called the  Clipper Chip  hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation  protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal  state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A  key escrow  system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2 keys   numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured  the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two  key escrow  data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The  Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology  theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition  respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryptions dual edge sword   encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry  but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the  Clipper Chip  and otherapproaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches  like the key escrow system  the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates           the privacy of our citizens  including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes           the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data  under proper court or other legal          order  when necessary to protect our citizens           the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace  and           the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries  the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high speed networks  information superhighways   will transmit video  images  HDTVprogramming  and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure  the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent  comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONSTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ    Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations A    No.   Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message A    They would have to obtain legal authorization  normally a     court order  to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts  which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q    Who will run the key escrow data banks A    The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point  the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key escrow data banks.Q    How strong is the security in the device   How can I be sure     how strong the security is   A    This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system  we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q    Whose decision was it to propose this product A    The National Security Council  the Justice Department  the     Commerce Department  and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President  the Vice President  and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q    Who was consulted   The Congress   Industry A    We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues  and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q    Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A    The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits  but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q    Who provides the  Clipper Chip  A    Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance      California  and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q    How do I buy one of these encryption devices  A    We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the  Clipper Chip  into their devices.     Q    If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed  would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices A    This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure  more convenient  and less expensive     than others readily available today  but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology  which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying   since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement      we will prohibit it outright   as some countries have     effectively done   nor is the U.S. saying that  every     American  as a matter of right  is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.   There is a     false  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is     an  either or  proposition.  Rather  both concerns can be      and in fact are  harmoniously balanced through a reasoned      balanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper     Chip  and similar encryption techniques.Q    What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration   A    It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans     privacy  help businesses to compete  and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q    Will the devices be exportable   Will other devices that use     the government hardware A    Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case by case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind  we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case by case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

Clintons immunization program,Distribution  usaOrganization  HSH AssociatesLines  47In article  C5FJsL.6Is ncratl.AtlantaGA.NCR.COM   mwilson ncratl.AtlantaGA.NCR.COM  Mark Wilson  writes   On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling  his so called stimulus package.  It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free  immunizations for poor kids.  So now Clinton is claiming that the republicans are holding the health of  poor kids hostage for blatantly political gains.    Aside from the merits  or lack thereof  of another free immunization program   just what is such a program doing in a bill that is supposedly about  creating jobs.Jobs   What the hell have jobs to do with it   Its another touchy feely program from the new  vapid administration.  The fact is  the major claimmade for  universal  immunization    that  all children will be immunized    has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs  havehad these programs for _years_. The result  on average  their success ratesare no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasntyet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in.  Yet another caseof shameless demagoguery from the  new  Democrats  the  agents of change.     If Clinton is so hot to get this immunization program  why doesnt he and  the democrats just introduce it as a stand alone bill. Isnt it possible  that Clinton is the one doing the blatant political  read pork  manipulations  here. He is telling the republicans  pass my muti billion dollar package   or I will go to the people and tell them that you are opposed to  immunizing poor kids.What   Clinton using this issue for _partisan gain_   Do tell.   I have never thought highly of Clinton  but stunts like this lower my  opinion of him even further.    I thought one of Clintons campaign themes was that he was going to be  a new kind of politician.

Im going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S W and the S W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more  safe    for lack of a better word  than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool  guess thats why they use them in so many movies  but I wouldnt get one as my first semi auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a  traditional  semi auto  ala Colt .45  but of course thats just my opinion.  Jason	At the risk of starting the my gun is better than yours flamewar  I must disagree.		There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact  it is oftenchosen  besides its other merits  because it shoots like a revolver doesbasically.  It can limit the training time  read budget      due to thefact there are no external safties other than the trigger  hence lesstraining time required. 	Smith   Wesson  among other types  are chosen due to the fact tahtthey do have the external safties  hammer drop as well as mag drop  whichif properly used have saved many lives when Mr. Bad snatched the gunfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe andwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various gun magazines.  If fact  one author  cant remember who  staged a littletest where he had a revolver and a S W on safe laying on a table and askedpeople with little firearms experience to on his signal  grab the gun andshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver timeswere pretty close  but some of the times with the S W were in minutes  orthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.	You dont often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light triggerwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation  opening the issuingcity county  etc.. to lawsuits  bad press  etc..	Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training  butsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  Iknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S W just for the offchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesnt guarantee thatMr. Bad wont figure it out and shoot me  but it could buy enough timeto draw a second gun and shoot Mr. Bad before its too late.	Dont think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocksin my possession at one time  because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact it was my first handgun.  Remember  the ultimate safety is YOU theoperator  and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge  note Idont say accidental  if you break the rules of gun handling.	As per the part of being light weight and looking cool  I agree100 .  I wouldnt rule it out as a first purchase.

Defensemen  2 19 ,"Organization  Computer Science Department  Stanford University.Lines  92I finally got it back  with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sendingit. 2	ROB ZETTLER		Season 	4thAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		C C Zettler gave the Sharks every bit hes got this year  unfortunately  this stillwasnt enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer  if that.  He workshard  for sure  but is no better than average on defense  and is prone tocostly penalties and defensive lapses at times  while being basically anoffensive zero  0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games .  He would be hardpressedto make the team next year. 3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season  2ndAcquired 	91 92  free agent from New JerseyGrade 		C C IMO  Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in 91 92 playing a combination of good offense  3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games  andgood defense.  But he  playing the first part of this season in Kansas City was good neither offensively nor defensively this year  it  then  appears that91 92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season  hewas prone to being out of position defensively  and did not demonstrate theplaymaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen lastyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year. 4	JAYSON MORE		Season  2ndAcquired 	91 92  from Montreal in expansion draftGrade 		B After being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training campbefore 91 92  More had a rather disappointing 91 92  as he was notparticularly good defensively  and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He  then proceeded to improve his game massively this season  becoming the teams mostreliable defenseman  whom the team can count on night in and night out to playsteady defense and providing occasional  but only occasional  offensive flash.Offensively  he was even more disappointing than last year  11 points in 73games   but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as thedefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman. 5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season  4thAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		B Wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in 91 92.  However partially because of injuries  he was not the same this year  as he missed 25games total due to nagging knee and back injuries  and seemed to be slowedeven when playing.  He  then  had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is  if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games  and ifhe can be complete healthy  he can still be a force. 6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season  1stAcquired 	91 92  2nd round pick in entry draftGrade 		I  A At the time of his injury  December 30  against the Philadelphia Flyers  Ozolinsh was well on track to be  IMO  the teams MVP.  A serious knee injuryin that game  though  forced him to miss the rest of the season  47 games  but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen  23 points  which  of course  tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had fromtheir defensemen  but it also tells of Ozolinshs abilities.  At the time  hewas playing very good defense along with excellent offense  he was stillsusceptible to so called  rookie mistakes   but was probably the defenseman whomade the least of them on the team  rookie or veteran.  If he can come backfrom his injuries  he is ready to be a star. 19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season  1stAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		BZmolek had basically a solid and durable year  being one of the only two Sharksto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense  butafter being billed as an offensive defenseman  he didnt show it  15 points .He was also prone to penalties  and his 229 penalty minutes was second on theteam  however  that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing toughphysical opponents  and he was at his best when playing physically.  But tobecome a fixture in this league  he needs to improve both offensively anddefensively  and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents.

Getting one in Scandinavia  and northern europe  is not easy. Average time is about 20 hours of training  and the cost is rather......Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on privateproperty  such as a farm  Here in the United States  the licenseis required only for the use of public roads. Abuse by the goverment  This seems to be one of the main problems  Any harder gun control would just be abused by the goverment.    Either some of you are a little paranoid  no offence...  OR you should get a new goverment.  You do have elections   We also have a nation of 250 million people  _many_ issues andusually only two candidates for a given office. A Presidentmight be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and createa de facto ban  something a majority of the people would object to and still be elected  The voters might look at issues like thecivil rights of minorities  health care  etc... and votefor the  lesser of two evils.  I dont think this is a matterof paranoia  since local governments in  for example  New Yorkand Chicago have abused existing  mild gun control laws to create a virtual ban. Guns n Criminals  MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen. Known criminals can NOT buy weapons  thats one of the points of gun control.In which case  the United States already has adaquate gun control laws According to federal statistic  only 7  of gun wielding criminalslegally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If thatsthe point of gun control  to prevent criminals from legally purchasingguns  then America doesnt need any additional laws to accomplishthis. Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one  What I meant was that cars CAN kill  but they are not GUNS How is this any different from guns  There are legal purposes forowning and using a gun  They are appropriate tools for hunting target shooting and self defence. Like cars  murder isnttheir only  or even a common  use. If 50  of ALL murders was done with axes  would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees  and that the axe is not a problem  its the axer   I certainly couldnt imagine the American public accepting regulationof axes. While the politics of other nations may be different in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law thatprimarily would effect the average  law abiding citizen who hadnot done anything wrong. Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. Is this a good situation    Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem   A good way to deal with which problem  It is an excelent way to deal with the short term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course it doesnt do anything for the long term issues that start riots. Butat this point  what can these individuals do about long term socialproblems   If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals  and their neighbor who have guns  what do you think will happen     I mean if everybody had a gun in USA There are  according to surveys  guns in 40  of American homes.In many parts of the country  this is closer to 100 . Those placeswhere almost everyone owns a gun are  on average  safer than thosewhere guns are less common. LAST WORD  Responsible gun owners are not a problem  but they will be affected if you want to protect your citicens.This is  I think  a fundamental difference between American governmentand that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punishor restrict the average  law abiding citizen in the name of somevague  common good.

It uses freon jets forsteering and a pulse width modulated controller for alignment  ieduring our eight minutes in space  the jets are pretty muchcontinuously firing on a  10  duty cycle or so... .  The jets alsoneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization  andflip the payload around to look at the Sun.We have two freon tanks  each holding  5 liters of freon  Im speakingonly from memory of the last flight .  The ground crew at WSMR choose howmuch freon to use based on some black magic algorithm.

computer graphics to vcr ,"Organization  University of VirginiaLines  16	Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotapeis harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  Whilethere is equipment that will do the conversion  it is hard toget your hands on and costs quite a bit.	If you have access to an Amiga computer  that has anNTSC output  you can transfer certain types of graphic files bymodem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately  thiswould be frame by frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchyanimation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.	Otherwise  see if your local public access cablestation has equipment that you can use."
Radar detector DETECTORS ,Organization  Virginias Public Education Network  Richmond Lines  27Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers  indefiance to Virginias law against radar detectors  passed outthousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops nearthe Virginia State lines.

Sabbath Admissions 5of5,Organization  Freshman  Civil Engineering  Carnegie Mellon  Pittsburgh  PALines  34All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the pointpretty clear   anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican orMonophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are reallysola scriptura.  Otherwise  they are following a law put into effect bythe Church  and only the above Chruches really recognize any power ofthe Chruch to do so.Andy Byler You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Churchestablishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath isthat it is part of the ceremonial law  and like the rest of theceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is basedon Pauls letters  Acts  and in a more general sense  Jesusteachings.  Further  most people argue that Scripture shows worshipoccuring on Sunday  and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that thesepoints are disputed  and do not want to go around the dispute one moretime.  The point Im making here is not that these arguments areright  but that the backing they claim is Scripture.Accepting the principle of  sola scriptura  does not commit us toobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Pauls letters are quiteclear on that.  I think even the SDAs accept it.  The disagreement ison where the Bible would have us place the line.By the way  Protestants do give authority to the church  in mattersthat are not dictated by God.  Thats why churches are free todetermine their own liturgies  church polity  etc.  If you accept thatthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians  then the day of worshipfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or since worship is by its nature a group activity  churches are free todecide.  clh

He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Bostonand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only inlearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing withhospitals  procedures...etc.I dont want to go into a lot of detail  but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weightas a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti convulsion drugsand that did not seem to help out. His MRI  EKG  cat scans are all normal but the EEGs show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests body structure tests  and infection virus tests the doctors still do notknow quite what type of siezures he is having  although they do have alotof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms  . This is wherewe stand right now....If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearingfrom you. I am not trying to play doctor here  but only trying to gatherinformation about it. As I know now  these particular types of disordersare still not really well understood by the medical community  and so Imgoing to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittleinsight.

IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWIST,Organization  California Polytechnic State University  San Luis ObispoLines  234 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE  IS GRAVITY     This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary  ether sucking structures  AND why we observe  orbital  motion    Ether  the theoretical propogation media of electro magnetic waves  was concluded not to exist  based on the results of the Michelson Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.   I propose that those conclusions are flawed  based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earths surface  not perpindicular.  Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind   The reversal of the that conclusion  a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought  could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD    REMEMBER  Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge    1  I dream like this  ether based reality   The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin  the latticesboth drag the fluid  like a margarita blender  and ingest it  converting it  distilling localized mass  time and energy.  non spinning lattice    dark matter    The earth isnt exactly spinning  around the sun. Picture an image of a galaxy  we havent any videos of them spinning. Picture us being stationary  and the suns image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field.  Picture an onion  each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways  its head being in a faster shell than its tail  until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel  its direction vector being straight down  but its  foot print  being a line  not a point.  sunrise  sunset      The moon isnt exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite   non self spin sustaining   being dragged in the earths ether field  which is itself in the suns much more powerful field. Our seasons are the wobble of earths axis  like a top slowing down. The  orbit  of theearth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged aroundby the suns ether feild.  The earth  moon and sun are about the same size and  distance  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly  because the  path  is not the same. The moons lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. The suns lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a  j  hook at the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate  like a needle in a record  before it gets there.   With a pencil  compass  and rule  draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as  earths  shadow upon it  and at other times totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge  would you guess that they are about the same size  just because they look about the same size    O .                         E     O   O   O   S E                              M                  OR                M               _ _                                  S                                    The full moon  quarter moon etc. is the difference between rateof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating  turntable view  of the moon  only half of which is facing the sun.   Ive seen a half moon within about 120 degrees  of sky  of the sun  during the day. Try and draw that  earth shadow.   Its only the moons image which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is  the light part is the part facing the sun  and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun  even when it appears to be behind us.   Light Years  between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is closer to zero  as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality  which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  defining edge   0 ether spin  What we are seeing could be essentially happening now. The  piece  of light may have experienced many years  but the trip could be very quick  our time.  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de spin myself.  phase out my mass  Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality.  its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within   To find out about all of this  I recommend studying history. Id look in the book of life.  or holy grail etc.  Brain waves just might carry decipherable data. Id start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable  due to all the background noise.  4  billion humans   Id totally isolate myself  record me thinking DOG backwards  and learn to read what I got.  Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium    Next  concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time bound media  the ether  and that it is I who move forward  in time . I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow   of time  which Id start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism  pole to pole.  Why not    perhaps by passing a LARGE  FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something  and seeing what I could get with my machines receiver next to it.    If you dont think youll live to see it  consider this  QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY  All of lifes data could be written on the wind   ether  not just our thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By eating SEEDS  we could be jamming our reception  or receiving plant instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. Im curios to see what they did and ate. Dont worry if your hair stops growing.  Maybe we dont need to eat at all  the cosmos are formed from nothing  and that is creating matter  I only need enough to bounce around. Where did the household concept immortal come from  Wheat is a weed  it is programmed to pull from the soil  reproduce like hell  and then die   Warning about writing to the past I had a little dream of being in a world  in the near parallel future  lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. There were  twelve telepathic  glowing beings  who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been  a dark one who looked like us  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods   he had to teach them what that meant  by  advising  them in their past. Basically  he manipulated them into reproducing  and raising their children on his seed. He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub species  meant to provide service. He carefully combed through history  rewriting it in his favor  pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions  saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls  kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was finite  though  as at every change he made  a void would appear in our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us  it seemed odd  but we couldnt remember how else it should be. Then some of the twelve were no more. Finally  when he could prune no more  and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips  he stepped through his portal to the past  to bask  over and over  in all that he had created. I made a few more changes  and lost my body  existing only on the wind.   MORAL  Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose wills are not in harmony with yours  Golden Rule   treat others as you wish to be treated  I.E.  you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown nosers for playmates.  its not eternal  theres more than one way back   Accepting rides to the past Once here  the one who looks like us sells rides  he can make you a Prince  or a Queen  or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go ahead  repeat the third grade as often as you like  Adam henry. I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though  if he likes your work  but thinks youre getting wise  he can direct you to cross paths with your old self  and youll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history  none the wiser.  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time  his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still make changes while hes here  its just that that is work  and with every adjustment  this becomes less the world he cultivated  which loosens his grip  and his organization is suddenly one branch less. But he cant see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built  the more sand slips through his fingers.   How about public computer access to the I.R.S.   Its our country  our money  and theyre spending it on us  RIGHT  Imagine this  Washington marks the next cost at 8  IRS collects 10  gives 5 to congress  and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks are making  what  a 30  margin  interest  on our government  Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10  margin. What do the banks do with it  Hold some on a carrot to the world  sure  but mostly  bury it. WHY  Food production is 2  GNP   construction 6    14 hours to build your auto   The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived  If we are more efficient  why is it getting harder to get by  What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets    In that other reality  I shouted to the twelve   its chaos   They said   no  its order.  He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control.  Rain forest  The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no language.  telepathic  and vanishing the closest knowledge of death  think of the spine as a transceiver  if it is on the ground and pointed up  you can locate it from above  These people are probably naive as children  but very  very tough to kill. Also  They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a different frequency than us as they arent eating seeds.  Famine relief  When I make my diet almost all whole wheat  I get a huge belly  lose muscle mass  sleep A LOT  and get sick. When I eat only fresh fruit  I get more energy  a Hollywood flat belly  and need a lot less sleep.  UN. Peace Keeping  There is fighting and killing all over. The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf.  its OK to kill each other  just make sure there is enough to eat.   Somalia  What is disturbing is energetic  gun carrying  three foot tall sixteen year olds  who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted  it is that they arent dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.   Women with children  Babes in arms  Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord.  and hence  were not breast fed  I think that there may be some very interesting results to this  such as mother child telepathy  and blue blooded infants. There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.  That guy is the master of illusion  and the ultimate liar. He tells it first  and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it.  in which he can make it so  Hell play a poker face up until he thinks hes cornered  and then hell whine  beg and grovel. All it means to him is that youre willing to live on the ground work that he has laid  that is  that he was right  and he didnt over play his hand  and he wont need to go back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over your destiny  just dont live along a path that leads to a reality in which you dont want to be a part of.   I dont claim to be the first to think these things  its just that the others could have been pruned from our path. Maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time  after him.

To start with  the  draft is immoral.

BATF FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today  4 19,Nntp Posting Host  chopin.udel.eduOrganization  University of DelawareLines  51In article  lt8keoINN31v appserv.Eng.Sun.COM  fiddler concertina.Eng.Sun.COM  steve hix  writes  In article  C5sIAJ.Ks7 news.udel.edu  roby chopin.udel.edu  Scott W Roby  writes     Why didnt they release the children weeks ago   It would have been inconsistent behavior for them to have done so.  Some people believe that there is more to life than the physical requirements.  These folks believed that the generally held standards of the surrounding community  heck  most of the world  were morally wrong  and letting the children be abandoned to this  godless unbelieving  culture would be condeming them to eternal loss and separation from God.  By their standards  letting the children go would be abandoning them to a fate literally worse than death.  The FBI  and BATF and media  people working on the issue  I suspect  just couldnt get their heads into a similar enough  to say nothing of identical  mode of thinking to realize what they were doing.  Physically  there was no reason why the BDs shouldnt have given up and come out a long time ago.  From the point of view of the BDs  they were up against the wall and had nowhere to go at all.  They apparently really did love their kids too much to abandon them to a godless bunch of outsiders...although the end result was horribly twisted.  I didnt say the BDs were right  I just said that thats the way they perceived it.  Koresh was a nutcase  and a bunch of other people paid for that.  And the FBI and BATF miscalculated and misunderstood what was going on from the word go.Very likely possible.  Reminds me of the movie  The Rapture .

Why not hand control  Its much much easier.    In the early days  neither of these functions had power assist  so  only legs had enough strength to activate them.  Since then  its  been traditional and people would have a hard time getting  used to anything else.   Well  where  exactly  would you put a hand clutch and brake  On a motorcycle  its easy  the handlebars have a very limited range of turning. Steering wheels  on the other hand  turn around and around and around...which is fine for electrical relays  like your cruise control and airbag   but how many of you want to lose your clutch and or brake due to a short circuit Shades of the Edsel  They had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hubthat controlled the auto tranny. It was very disconcerting to shiftinto reverse when turning a corner and the wires shorted. There are workarounds  but theres really no reason to use hand power on a cars clutch or brakes  and lightening them to the point that they are  finesse  controls suitable for hand use would increse the mechanical complexity substantially  look at power brakes and non power brakes for an example .  I saw an experimental car that had a joystick instead of a steering  wheel... Thats about useless  IMHO.    Another automotive oddity is separate keys for trunks  doors  and   ignitions. Why on earth would you want this     I know  I  dont. I want a separate trunk key for security reasons  it gives me a totally separate  lockable container.

Analog switches Balanced Demodulators,"Distribution  naOrganization  DSC Optilink Access ProductsLines  53In article  msf.734832494 skaro  msf skaro.as.arizona.edu  Michael Fulbright  writes  I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and Ive hit a snag. In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an op amp amplifier from 1 to  1  controlable via a digital input. The most obvious way Ive come up with is to use analog switches to adjust the gain of the op amp. The only analog switch I have experience with it the 4066. Unfortunately I want to switch an AC signal which goes from about  5V to 5V  and the 4066 is only for positive signals.  ...   I have a carrier signal which varies between 0V and  5V. I want to demodulate an input signal by feeding the input signal thru a amp with a gain of 1 when the carrier is at  5V  and thru a amp with a gain of  1 when the carrier is 0V. The output is then low pass filtered. I believe this is called lock in detection as well as synchronous demodulation.Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2 to 1 transmission gate analogmultiplexer  with positive and negative power supplies  can be runfrom a single ended supply as well .  With dual supplies  the logicinputs still range from ground  0 Volts  to VDD.This is a neat  well  I think so  design for a switchable polarityamplifier                                                                                                                INPUT                                                         opamp               OUTPUT                                                                                  CONTROL	         X  analog switch                                                                        GNDAll resistors are equal value.  When the analog switch is closed the amp is inverting gain of one.  With the switch open  it isnon inverting gain of one.  You can clean up the circuit to trimout input offset current if this hurts the balance  this would showup as carrier feed through .For high frequencies  the slew rate of the opamp might cause problems especially if it isnt symmetrical  and it usually isnt .

Top Ten Reasons Not to Aid Russians,Nntp Posting Host  eddie.jpl.nasa.govOrganization  Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Pasadena  CALines  137In article  C51qr5.Duu encore.com  rcollins encore.com  Roger Collins  writes  julie eddie.jpl.nasa.gov  Julie Kangas  writes   I suggest you  listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying  and compare that with the very anti West slogans coming from his  opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.  Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be theproblem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracyand reforms when they felt  rightly IMO  that the West didnt care.Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid  once Bush got over hisGorby mania.   This probably kept him from dismantling the congressand calling for new elections.  Well  the aid didnt come throughand we didnt make sure it went to the proper places and now theanti reformers are gaining strength where before they were inhiding.  Have you considered a non interventionist policy   If market reform does happen  Russia will certainly get  private  capital at  private  risk to help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same reason.  If they dont reform  then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them.If they dont reform I dont believe in giving them money.  However I think this is too important to take a non interventionist approach.This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism    it sounds likeitll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to doanything.    How does this affect us   Well  we are on the same planet and if  vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think wed feel something.  A massive breakup of a country that spans 1 6th the planet is  bound to have affects here.   Of course  there is also the  humanitarian argument that democracies should help other  democracies  or struggling democracies .   If a  1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being  couldnt it be raised voluntarilly   People already give over  100 billion a year to charity.Despite the wishes of Libertarians  this society is a far way  and gettingfarther  from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work ifwe had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face theproblem  now   not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade  let alone charity.There are still limitations to high tech exports.  NASA cant buyProton launch vehicles from them.  Sure  the market may be able tohelp a great deal but it cant right now.  There are too many obstacles.Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.   Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid.  My two  causes  are aid to Russia and a strong space program.  Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies  of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a  true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale  we  only have gridlock on a congressional scale.  It seems instead of gridlock on any scale  we have aid to Russia  expensive space programs  national charity that doesnt help the poor  and probably  studies of drunken goldfish.  I think  limited  government is more key than how democratic it is.Well  I think limited government is primarily democratic dueto it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transforma state run economy and monolithic government into something thateven remotely looks like ours    BTW  sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction   It is not going to bepainless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait tohelp when they  have  the proper government.  Theyll neverget there without the aid.  It may be too late already.   BTW  who is to decide stupid   This is just like those who  want to impose their morals on others    just the sort of  thing I thought Libertarians were against.  That was an opinion  and libertarians are very big on free speech.And Im just excercising mine.   Actually  my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue   and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems  that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and  let it sink or swim.  If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would your fellow Russia aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose werent using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you dont support As I also said above  another problem I have is with  transformation .A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.I have seen nothing about how to take our current government andsociety and turn it into a minimal government and a responsibleself sufficient populace.     We could do that 100 years ago but not now.  People have been saying that for hundreds of years.They didnt have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneouscommunications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth inless than a day.   Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and  global decision making.   All the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information  than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues.Yes  depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulersdo emerge  somewhere  and they will never represent the opinions ofevery person on the planet.  There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government whenit gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out ofbounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the marketis  to me  just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence ofgovernment.

Non lethal alternatives to handguns ,"Nntp Posting Host  beethoven.cs.colostate.eduOrganization  Colorado State University  Computer Science DepartmentKeywords  handgun mace pepper spray taser tasp phaserLines  102In article  1993Apr13.221936.28301 watson.ibm.com  mjp vnet.ibm.com  Michael J. Phelps  writes   In article  shepardC5FtLs.681 netcom.com   shepard netcom.com  Mark Shepard  writes     How effective are personal defense products like mace  pepper spray     tasers and other non lethal  stun  devices compared to handguns     Any statistics on  s and types in use         These products seem very attractive compared to handguns    because  being non lethal  they are more  forgiving  of accident or    mistakes wrongful shooting  such as the Yoshi Hattori case   and    allow the justice system to deal with the criminal  rather than    criminals simply being _dead_  which has a certain  vigilante feel     which seems to bother anti gun people .  The  more forgiving  nature also has its down side  it allows a criminal to use them w o the ADW  assault with a deadly weapon  charge.  They also can have lethal or dangerous side effects      some people have violent reactions to mace pepper sprays    stun guns can harm people with weak hearts    people have suffered eye damage from mace  the stuff that is available    now is less concentrated than it used to be.    some of the spray propellents are flammable         The arguments I see _against_ these non lethal weapons compared to    handguns are lack of range  lack of  stopping power  or effectiveness     and limited  ammo .  True   How about cost   Sprays    using any of the spray based  eg mace  pepper  indoors is bound to   affect anyone else in the room  like the victim  due to the nature   of the stuff.    using the sprays outdoors in any sort of breeze mitigates its    effectiveness.    from reading various articles  it appears that mace  especially the   mace available to citizens  is pretty ineffective on people under   the influence of drugs or alcohol.    pepper spray appears to be more effective  but has the inherent spray   delivery problem.  It still does not appear to be anything better than   a distraction that might buy you time to run like hell  if you can .  Consider that running like hell isnt always a viable solution.  For example  if you are dressed in boots and the assailent is dressed in sneakers .. you might have a tough time outrunning them   Tasars and Stun Guns    require contact with skin for max effectiveness  a jacket  like a    leather one  will mitigate its effectiveness    the user must be extremely close to the assailent  that puts them   at a considerable risk of injury.     the user must keep the stun gun in contact with the assailent for some   non negligible period of time.    tasar darts can be pulled out.  Consider the problem a small women would have keeping a stun gun in  contact with a average size man for any length of time w o sustaining serious injury.         Have any anti gun groups suggested non lethal weapons  to counter    the pro gun argument that people will be left defenseless   I havent heard of any.  Generally they contend that people dont need to  or arent able  to defend themselves.         And  what legal restrictions licensing apply to non lethal devices   Civilian ownership of stun guns is frequently illegal  NY .  The sprays are also illegal in some states.  Believe it or not  they are still  illegal in NY  although about half the state thinks they are legal   I believe that NY almost legalized them  i have heard that the reason they didnt was due to their ineffectiveness   I feel that the sprays are better than nothing  but only if the user does not believe the hype   thisll drop em in their tracks  stuff  and uses it as a diversion o_n_l_y .

Monthly Question about XCopyArea   and Expose Events,Reply To  buzz bear.com  Buzz Moschetti Organization  Bear  Stearns   Co.   FASTLines  18 2nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that containsXlib graphics.  A button widget  when pressed  will cause a new itemto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea    or equiv  directly  instead  it should register the existence of the newitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular  expose events  e.g. window manager driven exposures  take careof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a  proper  wayto do this because at the time the handler is called  the Xlib Window isguaranteed to be mapped.The problem  of course  is that no expose event is generated if the windowis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow  tickle  theWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enableit to render  just  the part of the window that contains the new item.What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

I am not posting here as an immature flame start  but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience. ...  1  The human being is an _animal_ who has  due to his her advanced mental facilities  developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  ... 	Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced	mental facilities which have not developed  religion  as a	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so 	Further  it appears that only humans have a  need  to explain the	unexplained.  Why is this so   The other animals on this planet 	including those with advanced mental facilities  seem perfectly	content in their ignorance.	Id like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me	from your unsupported statement.  They are  1  humans are animal	 only   2  religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need	not be researched  3  religion was  made up  by humans to address a	perceived need  4  the biological aspect of humans is deified  that	is  all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical	structure with biology at the apex .	Needless to say  I disagree with your strong opinion  1 and the	underlying presuppositions. Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1  it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.   Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.  For all of you  found jeezus    how many of you were  on the brink  	I disagree that Christianity is  an infectious cult .  It has	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system  in	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is	 infectious  in a derrogatory sense  it may be that it provides	a workable system for its adherents  and I would argue that this	is the case .	I disagree that Christianity is  a safety blanket  which supplants	hope and purpose.  Rather  it points an individual to the one	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a	Christians source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose	and externally given hope and purpose   Is the  apparent  loss of	control over ones own life the problem or is it something else 	Finally  one does not appropriate  eternal happiness  by following	Christian moral standards.  Indeed  the sole reason for the existance	of Christianity is  because  standards are inadequate to save people	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the	Christian  the real power to moral living is given to the Christian	in the Person of Gods Spirit.	Heaven is one of two final states that	Christian doctrine postulates.  However  Christians are generally	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this	promised future reward  rather  they are motivated by the perceived	benefits to them in the here and now. but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months  they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this    Priority  1 Spread the Word.	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a	priority  and rightly so  for it was Jesus Himself who gave this	as a priority for His followers .  However  it is not the penultimate	priority as evangelism is normally understood  i.e. preach the word 	convert at nearly any cost  repeat with new convert ad infinitum .	Rather  such evangelism is generally best done through respecting	the opinions of others while  demonstrating  the very real benefits	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful	that it compels the non Christian to seek out the Christian to ask	 Why    Needless to say  such a demonstration is not easily accom 	plished  it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus   it	does not happen quickly  so perseverance on the part of the Christian	is required   and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of	friendship exist  it is ineffective with strangers who cannot	evaluate the demonstration over time  and it is easy to alienate or	harm others if the sole purpose of being a  friend  is to gain a	conversion .	As a long time Christian  nearly 20 years   I view with some skep 	ticism  all  evangelism programs which incorporate a  hurry up 	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no	conversion at all  because the pressured convert realizes s he was	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now .	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings	conviction of wrong doing to people.  I am content to do my part	 witness  and let the Spirit do the rest. We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep  food  and we reproduce.  And we die.      	We are far more than animals.  We sleep  eat  reproduce  and die	just as other animals do   true.  But  we are also capable of more	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity  or of yourself  is	so limited  I can only hope and pray     that you will someday find	a more expansive view.	 For reflection  what animals have the wide variety of performing	arts that humans do   How is it that humans can learn the language	of other humans  or animals  but that other animals cannot do so 	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social	structures whereas other animals have only one structure   Religion  especially Christianity  is nothing more than a DRUG.	Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.	Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not	a  thing  which one snorts ingests shoots up  it is a relationship	with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close 	knit relationship with this appelation. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high. 	There are  Jesus freaks  who let the emotional aspects of worship	and Christian living gain  and retain  the upper hand.  Even so 	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these	things flow. It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars  of which Christianity has had no small part.	Guilty by association   That  christianity  which forces itself	upon another is not Christianity at all. When Christians see a  non believer   they say that person is blind to the truth  but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet  37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were  circa 69ad  dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.	You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened	2000 years ago.  How did you come by it 	I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus influence was a sole	result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30  years	gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert	that nothing about Jesus life was noteworthy _until_ the sack. I must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.	Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.

Declassifying media,Organization  capricciosoX Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL6 Lines  82There are many Urban Legends  maybe this ought to be in the Crypt FAQ   about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify magnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some information  from the horses mouth . Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media   clearing   meant to be  retained  within the controlled environment  or declassifying the material to be reused  outside  the controlled environment  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security  NTISS   Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines    NTISSAM COMPUSEC 1 87         7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic MediaCertain types of removable media  e.g.  magnetic tape  floppy disk  cassettes  and magnetic cards  may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendors formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character.Fixed media  e.g.  Winchester disks  should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by applying a vendor supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character  if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this.Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction  however  they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded.7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic MediaCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type.   A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA. If a fixed medium  for example  a hard  or Winchester  disk  is operative  an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character  then its complement  e.g.  binary ones and binary zeros  alternatively.When fixed  media become inoperative  it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method.  In this case  there are two alternate procedures that may be used   1  disassemble the disk pack  and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment  and  2  courier the inoperative media to the vendors facility  have the magnetic media  e.g.  disk platter  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media  see DoD Computer Security Center   Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline   CSC STD 003 85  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY       This and many other interesting documents  many that are more informative than probably intended  on computer security procedures can be obtained  free  from Executive SecretaryNational Telecommunications and Informations  Systems Security CommitteeNational Security AgencyFort George G.

This is from Sams Reference Data for Engineers   seventh edition  Pg 5 30  which claimsin turn to be from MIL STD 275C...    width   Temp rise    inches  degrees C                          .125	100     .15	 75     .17	 60     .20	 45     .24	 30     .33	 20At 10 amps  the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.Power goes as square of the current  plus the copper resistance goesup as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20    5mm  traces should be ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the required width in half.   Id do 2 oz at about 0.08  width myself  I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 isa transient or fault condition.  Theres another question  will the voltage drop be low enough But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables orjust the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separatesensing traces where appropriate  as mentioned by another poster. "

Canon BJ200  BubbleJet  and HP DeskJet 500   ,Organization  Hewlett Packard VCDX Newsreader  Tin 1.1 PL5Lines  9thomas.d.fellrath.1 nd.edu nd.edu wrote   The key issue that I bought my BJ 200 on was ink drying speed.  You really   have to try awful hard to get the BJ 200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need   10 15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases  however  do not get your   pages wet.  Unlike laser printers  the material on your pages is INK  not   toner.  But that should go without saying.I think the ink now used in the DeskJet family is water fast.

Political Atheists  ,Organization  VideOcart Inc.X Newsreader  Tin 1.1 PL3Lines  23     The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime   but the legal     shenanigans that have been added  automatic appeals  lengthy court     battles  etc.  have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what     it should be.  Hence the question is   do we instate the death penalty as     it was meant to be  and see if that deters crime  or do we get rid of     it entirely   I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a  deterrent  to crime. If so why doesnt every crime carry a death penalty   That would be effictivewouldnt it      The death penalty is a punishment  much like a  50 fine for speeding isa punishment. Anyway  somebody with murder on the mind doesnt much careabout the consequences. I think another problem is that people dont thinkthey will get caught. If I wanted to kill another person  I wouldnt care what the penalty was if I didnt think I would get caught.  If it was to be strictly a deterrent  it should have been more along the lines of torture.Dave Fullerdfuller portal.hq.videocart.com
Diamond Stealth 24   Windows problems   ,Summary  Users complain of service from Diamond.Reply To  lance hartmann.austin.ibm.com ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.comOrganization  IBM  AustinKeywords  diamond video s3 windowsLines  43In article  1pifisINNhsr dns1.NMSU.Edu  jdiers dante.nmsu.edu  DIERS  writes   I own a Stealth 24 card from diamond.  When using the 640X480x16.7mil win 3.1 driver the card and driver work but are not very fast.  ALL of the other windows drivers have a number of bugs.  Shadows remain when windows are erased and text boxes are often unreadable.  All attempts to get help from Diamond have failed.  I have called the Tech support and never been able to get past the hold line  a toll call  in a reasonable time  ie 10min . Leaving voice mail has not helped either.  The BBS is a joke  It always has too many people on to download anything.  You cannot even get a file listing  it considers that a download  .  I have faxed the tech support group. All this with no reponse.  The bottom line is if you are looking for a fast card and want to use it for windows  DO NOT get a Diamond product.  Try another vendor  I wish I had.While others here may have had better experiences  I  too  share thesentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth VRAM it is only  relatively  recent that the Windows drivers for this cardhave evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there areSTILL a couple of modes I cannot use  ie. will not  due to shadowing mis drawn check boxes  etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.If theres a more recent release  Id appreciate if someone woulddrop me a note to let me know    I havent been able to get on theirBBS lately to check again.  Naturally  Diamond doesnt even bothernotifying me of fixes releases.Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the  right  person in curingsome of my Windows problems due to an address conflict.  The conflictingaddresses  2E0  2E8  were OMITTED in at least my version of theDiamond VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech repexplained that ALL S3 based boards use these addresses.  I have notconfirmed the validity of that statement.When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future  hopefully with someform of local bus   Ill seek a video solution from someone other thanDiamond.Lance Hartmann  lance hartmann.austin.ibm.com ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com                Yes  that IS a    percent sign  in my network address.

Fast idle on 88 Ford Ranger,"Reply To  ljbartel naomi.b23b.ingr.comOrganization  Intergraph CorporationLines  21It did it again.  This morning  my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10 000 RPM.Ok  so I exaggerated a little  but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2liter carburated engine in it  and no blipping of the throttle wouldcause the idle to drop back to normal  I dont think the linkage is stuck .What can I do to fix this problem   This has been a problem from time totime  but has straightened itself out   until now.  I dont have a tach but by gauging by the sound of the engine  it is idling about twice as fastas it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled upat a stop light.Many thanks for any suggestions.   les   Les Bartel			Im going to live foreverIntergraph Corporation		... or die tryingElectronics Division		ljbartel ingr.comor ljbartel naomi.b23b.ingr.com 205  730 8537"

was Go Hezbollah  ,Organization  University of Illinois at UrbanaLines  17mafifi eis.calstate.edu  Marc A Afifi  writes  Lets not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people  not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers  in the line of duty  were killed by the opposition. That still doesnt mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.  Should we be happy when they die   As I said before  the question is notwhether or not you agree with the policies of Israel.  You may wish for theIsraelis to cease occupation  but dont rejoice in death.  marcEd.

I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor.     I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip.     Is this true  I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS     slot.  Is that true           Thanks     David Mirsky     mirsky gnu.ai.mit.edu    Well  I also have an LC III.

I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit  in the PDS  but thats the only place.  So  will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade  or will it require a logic board swap  It would be interesting for Apple to come out witha NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPUs 680x0  like RocketShare. But I guess thats getting a bit fantastic I was wondering  since MacWeek reported that developers were seeded withPowerPCs on a NuBus card.Also  any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed  Last I heard  the estimates were around 3 4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. Iheard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machinesat a much earlier date that Q1 94  but I doubt its true.Finally  is the PowerPC developers CD mini course available  I saw it advertised in the developers university calendar  and Id like to know if itsat all  interesting .Sean              seanmcd ac.dal.ca"

race and violence,Nntp Posting Host  top.magnus.acs.ohio state.eduOrganization  The Ohio State UniversityDistribution  usaLines  29Joe      As usual  this issue of dysfunction  of bad values  of messed up culture is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explainingproblems in our community. From your post  you apparently find the idea thatsomething is wrong with African Americans  value wise  culture wise orsomething  very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non africanamericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assertthat something is wrong with us. The socio economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels  like poverty  which exists among us in large proportion  I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems  wesomehow become exempt from all these types of factors  and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No  that has socioeconomic factors to it  but for africa americans  its gotta be a dysfunction.Basically  I think this tendency for non african americans to believe thatsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans dont want todeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against africanamericans  and that this is about 80  of the problem. It could not possible bethat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us  that this hasa very effective negative effect on us. No  something is wrong with us.Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say  because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us  instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it werent so damn typical.Peace   Aaron

When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600  everything is  fine  but whenever I use it in 800x600  Windows  AutoCAD  GIFs  the screen   gets about 1 1 2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen  there is about a 3 4  bar of black.  The screen isnt cut off  it just squeezes  everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can  manually change the V Size on the back  this is a pain in the ass  and it just  shouldnt happen anyway.  Ive called Gateway numerous times and they havent   been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card  and  both times the new card didnt work at all in my computer.  They even tried  to bill me for the first card because they didnt get it back in a couple of  days  when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks  before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...  So  if anyone has had this same problem  please let me know if you know what  to do.  Hell  let me know if you dont have a solution  just so I know Im  not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.    Jude M. Greer  jmgree01 starbase.spd.louisville.edu    P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set   ting up the card.  Doesnt work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size  of the 800x600 screen  it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.  Maybe its a monitor problem.

He stated that thousands of bibles were discovered  at a certain point in time which were syllable perfect.  This therefore  meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time  the time quoted  by my acquaintace was approximately 50 years after the death of Jesus.Hi Adda Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certaintime    the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately  like all worksfrom this time period and earlier  all that exists today are copies.     Cutting all of the crap out of the way  ie god wrote it  could anyone answer  the following     1.  How old is the oldest surviving copy of the new testament There are parts of books  scraps really  that date from around themid second century  A.D. 130  .  There are some complete books  letters etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection ofthe New Testament dates from the early 4th century  A.D. 325 .  Throughoutthis period are writings of various early church fathers leaders whoquoted various scriptures in their writings.  2.  Is there any truth in my acquaintances statements If you mean that someone discovered thousands of  Bibles  which were allperfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts  within thedates given above  but not letter perfect  and that the most probabletext can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliestoriginal autographs  now lost  probably were written starting sometimeshortly after A.D. 50  then yes.  3.  From who where did the bible originate From the original authors.  We call them Matthew  Mark  Luke  John  Peter Paul  James  and one other not identified.  4.  How long is a piece of string     As long as you make it.    Adda       Regards Jim B.

The single payer model  sometimes called national health insurance   eliminates private insurance companies and removes health care from  employment. The government provides free health care to all U.S.  residents. And there are no out of pocket costs. Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure  but public  healthinsurance  like we use in Canada  rather than self enclosed HMO likesocialized medicine  30  of our costs comes from private supplementaryinsurance and or copayments.  France Magazines Summer 1992 editionhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1 30 days youre covered for 80  of the public hospital rate  100  afterward.With extra private insurance  you can get into a private hospital andbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  Thepublic insurance covers 100  beyond 30 days  or the same cash amountfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out of pocket oraccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2 3rds ofFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So  30  of healthcosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from othertaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expendituresfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13 14  figurefor the U.S.That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fundis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such backin Canada  to make the Canadian insurance look more like real healthinsurance    which actually it is .  The new Reform Party  a breakoffof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly  libertarian faction  hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but thatjust a few people have to be reminded that its not free  the averageCanadian European is more fiscally naive than their Americancounterparts on issues like these .Im one of the few people who favour copayments  forget aboutleftists  even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadiannewsgroups  to make it look more like real insurance  cos the 100 insurance payment is hidden  unlike in France  and if you didnt knowit  youd believe it actually is socialized medicine  Americanconservatives libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones whoseriously call it that .  Canadians arent worried about theAmericans  who spend 14   were worried about the French and Germanswho spend 7  to our 9  ... so the insurance is looking at things thatshouldnt be paid for out of general funds like physicals forinsurance policies  sick notes  electrolysis  etc.  The reason thatthe Canadian health insurance hasnt spiralled out of control despitebeing open and universal is that unlike Americans  there is no urge tospend all of your benefits worth  and more if you can ... were adifferent culture. Like the play or pay model  managed competition leaves in place two  elements of the current health care system that reformers most often  criticize  the private  for profit insurance industry  and the  employer based system of coverage. Managed competition compels  employers to enroll their workers in large pools of health insurance  customers. Entire industries may  for example  sponsor a pool or  network. Insurance companies  doctors  hospitals and other health  care providers then bid for the pools business  competing  in  theory  on the basis of price and quality.  Managed Care  relies on HMOs  which are unknown in most westernnations that use only public health insurance like Canada  Franceand Germany  Im Canadian  and my German father in law to be saysof HMO NHS approaches   We left that behind with East Germany   .Sure  HMO NHS controls costs because you have managers stranglingdoctors with budget strings.In Canada  we use the public health insurance approach as in Franceand Germany  with all private doctors and both private and publichospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMOs.  The divisionsare different  with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked sickness funds  over a century old while Canada divides by theirprovinces  who run the insurance fund and set local fees with thedoctors monopoly  federal funds cover the fees disbursed. With such an open ended system  its no surprise that Canada is  2 tothe U.S. in costs  all insurance is the most expensive way to go. TheFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populationsin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.gld                           Je me souviens                              Gary L.

EIGHT MYTHS about National Health Insurance  Pt II ,"Nntp Posting Host  cunixb.cc.columbia.eduReply To  gld cunixb.cc.columbia.edu  Gary L Dare Organization  PhDs In The HallLines  156v140pxgt ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu  Daniel B Case  writes  gld cunixb.cc.columbia.edu  Gary L Dare  writes...  The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.     Lack of defensive medicine and near absence of malpractice is really                                                                        why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance                     And maybe thats not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health  system class action suits are nearly impossible  and you cant sue the provincial health officials at all.Since our doctors are private and the  system  is just an insuranceplan  litigation would not involve the insurance fund.  Our lawyersdo not work on contingency  so that if you were to sue for malpracticethen youd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise if you were a doctor and subject of a suit  its time to sweat.  Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when  the fee schedule hikes are presented  the politically bent doctors  were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength  rather than diminish  especially when unopposed unlike in socialized  medicine approaches like Britains National Health Service.  Oh no. Dont let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it  is. Ask most Americans whether theyd like the doctors lobby to get  more powerful.A few weeks ago  the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter tothe NYT to decry a lobbyists advert repeating the same old trash.This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinkedorganizations and he would not have done it without the approval of his AMA cronies. Well  yeah  tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa.  Theoretically its limited to service personnel  but some studies Ive heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but arent  urgent  at all.It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... sincenot all hospitals can provide everything  maybe they have some stuffthat others dont    Ottawas population is only a quarter million if you include the surrounding counties.  The problem is  in a system where hospitals annual budgets are  approved by the government  how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions   I bet that if youre an MP or MPP  or good friends with one  youre put on any hospitals  urgent  care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK unless youre someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.People of influence will get their way in any system  American orEuropean.  Its the  Golden Rule    he who has the gold makes therules.    As for annual budgets  those are actually annual grants for facilities e.g.  mops  pans  etc.  given to hospitals of which most are privatenonprofit foundations  btw  I have no problem with having aggressivefor profit hospitals like the French  who use our approach ... but inthe Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does sotheir market is much more diverse .  The rest has to be made up forby billings from patients who use their services.   WOULDNT NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW     FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS         In Canada  provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental     care  eyeglasses  prescription drugs  ambulance service  and private     hospital rooms     so many Canadians do end up buying some private     insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about  40 to  40     a month.    Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage  of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included  in the accounting    Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much  on health care as we do.The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for totaloutlay  and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield the 13 14  figure for the U.S. So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.How   They are collecting premiums ... and Im an advocate of havingcopayments like the French do in their system in order to make it lookmore like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and hospitals will still be there after the insurance  hypothically disappears  as they were there before it appeared. Bob Rae  the second least popular man in Ontario  warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didnt stop cross border shopping in such huge numbers   the services they expect from the province just wont be there in a few years For one thing  I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ... He didnt say so  but I knew he meant the OHIP.Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you area player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than thehealth insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending buthealth insurance  which is separate and optional  and it is being spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party.    OHIP is just a health insurance plan  it does not provide any kindof health care  that is up to you and your private doctors. Would the private insurers take up the slack  Theyd be under no obligation to. Of course  they could eventually make money again   but if what you say is true  theyd be loathe to do so  and out of practice in handling such basic services  too .Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries ofAmerican companies  and their parents provide full insurance downhere.  Regardless  all firms up north can easily turn on cable TVto see how well the American firms are doing by being involved inbasic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money afterhaving gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras for those people who  deserve it .  When private insurance realized how much money theyd make without the  risks involved in basic insurance  e.g.  neurosurgery  versus deluxe  amenities  e.g.  having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on  the fritz in someones private hospital room   they started to pat  themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec  last spring  a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against  any thoughts of privatizing routine  low cost parts of that provinces  public health insurance plan.  Again  I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that much power. I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers didnt go  along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run  and then afterwards they could clean up  Okay  this  sort of contradicts what I said higher up. But its another possibility . Theyd have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry as they could then point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.I agree ... they were in a win win situation.  But right now  it seemsthat they have won bigger  when you look at how full their coffersare.  Friends from my sisters MBA class were still being flown outfor job interviews individually with insurance firms in London  ON  Canadas insurance capitol a la Hartford  along with generous expenseprivileges this year despite the ongoing post recession blues.gld                           Je me souviens                              Gary L.

Various aspects of marriage are discussedin some of Pauls letters  Ephesians 5 sees marriage as a symbol ofGods relationship with the church.  If it means specifically that themarriage ceremony isnt described  then that seems to be true.  But Ithink what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much thatit takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the variouscommitments to each other that are associated with marriage in theBible.    clh

Shotguns are used mainly for hunting in Norway ...   but because it  	was so easy to accuire one  it was THE most used gun in crimes.  	The solution was to restrict the sale  so its now necessary to   	apply and register your shotgun.  	And  unbelievable  the use of guns in crime fell.....Did the RATE of crime fall   If not  the ban was of no use.  It is the rate of  violent crime that matters  not the tools used.

airhorns on an FJ1100 review            ,"Organization  Institute for Astronomy  HawaiiLines  44For those of you who are thinking about fiamms  you might also want to thinkabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from Dennis Kirk  pg. 282 of the latest catalog  on my 85 FJ1100. They are ratedat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery tothe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relaypins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor  and useda crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse connector from NAPA.	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the frontfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tubeframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing todo this  but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the twovertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairingfollows the frame  you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.The compressor is about 2  in diameter and about 5  long.	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame  it is smallso there should be plenty of good places for it.	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps tomount. The horns fit inside the front fairing frame and stick out on either sidejust in front of the air scoops  but behind the turn signals. The back of thehorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to wherethe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enoughroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance  and there are nicecut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.	The short horn is even with the fairing  and the long one sticks outabout an inch or so  but it is really not that noticable unless you lookclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straightahead  perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you .	If you have any other questions about the mounting  email  and I can tryto explain better. If your bike is not red  then you may want to paint themfirst.	How do they work you ask  They are very  very  very  LOUD . They soundmore like a european sports car than a truck  but a vast improvement over stock.I have used them at least daily since installing them  and the 10 amp fuse hasnot blown yet  although  the duration of the horn blasts have been short .	Ive repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them  even thoughthey know that I have the horns  they still jump. They are perfect for keepingthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.The bottom line is they work  are loud enough to cause pain and suffering tothose stupid lane changing cages  as well as take a few years off their lives and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

Thanks to eck panix.com  Mark Eckenwiler  andthf2 kimbark.uchicago.edu  Ted Frank   my account is to be axed.I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficultfor them to deal with. They  ONLY Ted and Mark  have complained to mysysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net.  In hisdefense  Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad  it hasbeen posted in one of the newsgroups  However  it  was  not directedat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at respondingvia netmail... While I disagree with Ted  I would not send mail to his sysadminto get him axed. Name calling was not enough  jumping on every postI made was not enough  ignoring specific points when they were notwhat the desired picture was not enough  SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF IAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have himaxed  but I do wish to express my disgust about this.  Argumentumad silence your opponent um    I would have thought he would havewanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about andseem sooo wise...  to himself  I think .The issue that seems to be   Is the following an advertisement  Apparently  Ted and Mark think so...1  I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 	 off the net  from last year. If reposting an article	constitutes posting an ad  then I am guilty. This post	did have a name and address and  yes  a price. If one	had posted the address and subscription price of  Newsweek  	would that be an ad  I get nothing from showing this stuff.2  I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of	 proof  that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and  lo and	behold   poof   there goes my account. This one had an	address in it  Oh  no  I Guess that means it is an ad If you value the alternative view I have been discussing  or VALUEITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it  I ask that you senda note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get Ya know  that user on your net was real helpful...  or whatever  theyonly get  I dont like what that user is doing because... .Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to themin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying  Thanks forthe info  or  Could you send me such and such   or  Your posts arevery interesting... keep it up.  and only a handfull of  Go aways . But I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying toconvince Ted is a Net Offense TM  of such magnitude as to warranta message complaining about me.  Knock  knock... My name is Ted andand this is Mark... Were from the thought police. Seems you havesome pretty dangerous ideas here  and were here to confiscate them...  NWO Indeed Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up witha new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.I will be on for a few more days and then... thats all folks Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer postto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefitfrom making alternative views simply vanish  Not in my book. Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing sideshut up. Images of Waco.... ah  but alas... And all this when I am in theprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying thata lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.Oh  well... It takes time to come up with the info requested  and Iwas just getting started.It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to thecontrary. Further  what ARE Ted Franks motivations for getting me axed We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on peopleon the net that are of  interest  to the government  and Ted sure seemsto have a  personal  interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who doeshe work for  The University of Chicago which he  attends     is wellknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...And finally  if anyone would be able to help me find a new account herein the Boulder Denver area  I would greatly appreciate it. I am in theprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybea TC IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since Iam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERYsoon  I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via 	A. J.

Is it really apples to apples    Lawful vs  unlawful use of guns ,Originator  mjp bwa.kgn.ibm.comReply To  mjp vnet.ibm.com  Michael J. Phelps Organization  IBM Kingston NYLines  51In article  1993Apr16.092618.22936 husc3.harvard.edu  kim39 scws8.harvard.edu  John Kim  writes    I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective    self defense  but something strikes me as odd among the   pro RKBA arguments presented here.      The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands  indeed  even a   million  of instances of law abiding citizens deterring   criminal activity  seem valid to me.  Likewise the number   of gun caused homicides each year  about 11 000 year  .  However    it is surprising that the  Evil AntiGun Empire    Darth Vader   breathing sound effect here  never tries to compare    All legitimate gun defenses  vs.  All gun crimes.   Instead     its always  All legitimate gun defenses    which includes   cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed  and   cases in which the criminal is not here  vs. just    criminal gun homicides  which only includes case sin which   the victim died.      Why is this   Of course  it wouldnt be unreasonable to say   that in each crime already measured  involving guns   the   consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that   a gun based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn   into a gun basd robbery homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate   gun defenses  one may assume that all those criminals who   were deterred would have committed more crime or more   serious crimes had they not been deterred.I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost  all other gun related crimes dont result in lives_lost.  On the other hand  its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses  prevented lives from being lost.  In other words  the lives_lost is pretty clear  its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter number   while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful  self defenses.  Clearly that percentage doesnt have to be real  high to show that lives_saved   lives_lost.As a semi related point  check out Klecks  Point Blank .  I believe it goes into some related areas  it also is well written and informative.

The 040 has 2 clocks  an internal processor clock  PCLK  that is 2x freq of external bus clock  BCLK  which is the one used to rate the chips  Bradley Lamont  Motorola 68040 data book .  Some compilers produce programs sensitive to the PCLK and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler chip  but this very compiler and program dependent.  Compliers maybe written to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040s PCLK in the future.

Color Support Display Mac  30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 32 bit color through 32 bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32 bit color QuickDraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X bit images in Y bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y bit color  Where X and Y independently are 1  2  4  8  16  or 32  regardless of monitor resolution  63 dpi  12  color  to 94 dpi  PaletteBook   or monitor type  including autosynchronous VGA  MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor  MacUser Aug 1992  158 176 .  Older machines that supported color  SE 30  II  IIX  and IIcx  had only 8 bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32 bit color  MacUser Special 1993 28 29 .  To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display capability built in  but most of those can be expanded to display 24 bit color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display  QuickDraw QX will change this.In addition  QuickDraw allows  in Macs with a NuBus slot  more then one monitor to be used in any combination  from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures.VRAM  Video RAM.  Standard for present non PowerBook Macs handling of  built in video  from a 32 bit color palette . VRAM provided runs a 8 bit color 640x480 display  expandable to 16 bit color or a 8 bit 832x624 display. Sound output   Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became  standard with the SE 30.IBM   Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware  Nan Zou   the use of drivers bypassing BIOS  video hareware inconsitancies  see Super VGA below  and nonstanderzationof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware  OS and program interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question  Faisal Nameer Jawdat . In addition  IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present  Matt Healy  nor a standardized screen drawing toolbox  like Macs QD . As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly  At present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program  OS  print driver and monitor card that editing 32 bit pictures regardless of color mode  OS  and monitor type card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with an IBM.  For example  one cannot edit a 32 bit color picture done on a OS 2 486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA  18 bit color palette  and DOS 5.0 and still have ALL the colors one started out with .Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators  faster processors  and modular upgradeability and may have built in sound cards  CD ROM  and Ethernet  PC Week 12 14 92 .

Common on the initial PS 1 implementation from IBM and some PS 2 Models.SVGA   Super VGA  This is not a standard in the way the others were  but instead was a catch  all category for a group of video cards.  As such  with each manufacturer  using their own implementation scheme  SVGA was chaos with people debating as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a  standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units  but things are still a mess.  Video is either 512K   1990  or 1M  today   resolution of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common  newer ones  since  1990  have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC  giving 15 bit 32 768 colors at 800x600   some of the very newer ones   6 92  can do 24 bits per pixel  usually  at 640x480 .

Up to 1280x1024 on OS 2. some monitor types usable by Mac See Mac section above for specific details.ExpansionBoth Mac   IBMSCSI  only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device  hard drive  printer  scanner  Nubus card  expansion  Mac Plus only   some monitors  and CD ROM.   Main problem   there are a lot of external devices which are internal  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the  end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM . SCSI 1   7 devices per SCSI controller.  8 bit asynchronous   1.5MB s ave  and synchronous  5MB s max  transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI 1 software drivers.   Fast SCSI 1  is a misname for 8 bit SCSI 2 in SCSI 1 mode  see SCSI 2 for details .SCSI 2  10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI 2 mode.  SCSI 2 is fully SCSI 1 compliant and 8 bit SCSI 2 tends to be implemented as a very fast SCSI 1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in   hardware and software that 16 and 32 bit SCSI 2 do.  Transfer speeds are 4 6MB s with 10MB s burst  8 bit   8 12MB s with 20MB s burst  16 bit   and 15 20MB s with 40MB s burst  32 bit wide and fast .  Since 8 bit SCSI 2 can use SCSI 1 software drivers and hardware at 8 bit SCSI 2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called  fast SCSI 1 .  16 bit fast SCSI 2 requires a SCSI 2 software driver and SCSI 2 electronics but can still use the SCSI 1 ports.  Wide 16 bit and 32 bit SCSI 2 require a different SCSI port  electronics  and software driver from SCSI 1  Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces .Mac SCSI  asynchronous SCSI 1 built in standard since the Plus.  Even though  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers  the OS SCSI Manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI interfaces.  As a result present SCSI 2 Macs use 8 bit SCSI 2 as a fast  asynchronous SCSI 1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI 2 controller chip built in  Digital Review  Oct 21  1991 v8 n33 p8 1    though they lack some other parts of the hardware  like the wide SCSI 2 port  interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI 2  older NuBus  Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor some Cyclone Macs  June  will come with a wide   fast SCSI 2 port standard  and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.IBM SCSI   SCSI 1 is not too wide spread yet  generally not bundled with  systems  except as add on  EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable . Like the Mac  8 bit SCSI 2 is used as a very fast SCSI 1 by most controllers out there.  Unlike the Mac  IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.MacMemory expansion  with a few exceptions the Mac has used non parity 30 pin  8 bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32 pin 9 bit parity SIMMs could be used in these Macs  only special IIcis could make use of the parity  feature  By convension both SIMM types are called 32 pin SIMMs .  The IIfx  used 64 pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III  C610 650 and Q800 all use a new  72 pin SIMM that is accessable by 32 bits at a time and is used in IBMs. The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing reading every memory location  if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is. Since Macs made before Feb 15  1993 managed memory baced on data path  SIMMs  had to be installed in pairs  16 bit  or in sets of 4  32 bit .  The Centris  650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that  allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same  size are used then the memory is interleaved across the two SIMMs resulting  in a 10 15  performance boost on RAM access  MacWorld Apr 93  108 109 .Printers  ADBs  and modems  built in interfaces standard.Monitor interface and sound input  built in on most present macs.

Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a ROM based system due to the patches needed.

Ive just finished reading S414  and have several questions aboutthe Brady bills  S414 and HR1025 .1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill      What is the status of these bills   Ive heard theyre  in committee .     How close is that to being made law 2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important   differences I missed 3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes   A. S414 doesnt specify an  appeals  process to wrongful denial during     the waiting period  other than a civil lawsuit      S414 has an appeals     process once the required instant background check system is established      but not before .  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying approving     using existing records  so who would I sue in  A  above to have an     inaccurate record corrected    C. S414 includes an exception to waiting period clause for if a person     can convince the local Chief Law Enforcement Officer  CLEO  of an     immediate threat to his or her life  or life of a household member.     But S414 doesnt say exactly what is considered a  threat   nor does     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception     statement.True   Have I misunderstood   Any other holes 4. With just S414  whats to stop a person with a  clean  record from   buying guns  grinding off the serial numbers  and selling them to crooks    At minimum  what additional laws are needed to prevent this    Seems at min. a  gun counting  scheme would be needed    e.g.   John Doe owns N guns  .  So  if S414 passes  I wouldnt be surprised   to see legislation for stricter  harder to forge I.D.s plus national gun   registration  justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.Please comment.  Im mainly interested in specific problems with the currentlegislation  I dont mean to start a general discussion of the meritsof any all waiting period bills ever proposed.

Because homosexuals support laws to force    employment of homosexuals against the will of some employers  they    are attempting to interfere with private acts between mutually consenting    adults.       Ok  Ill leave others to discuss your use of statistics  but I think Im  able to discuss liberterian ideas.     The ideas are good. They seek to maximise individual rights by keeping  governments out of transactions between consenting adults. If an employer wants  to discriminate against a group  she he should be allowed to to maximise their  freedom. The discriminatees can go elsewhere.     Unfortunately  it doesnt relate to maximising total individual rights  within a community. If an employer or shopkeeper or whatever can discriminate  in this way  then the freedom of the discriminatee goes down. Because people do  not live in perfect economic conditions  with perfect mobility  unlimited  numbers of potential employers of their skills  unlimited places to buy goods   the liberterian argument leads to a  decrease  in the amount of liberty in the  community. You mean  if a large part of the population supports discrimination against homosexuals  they will be injured.

Clipper considered harmful,Distribution  inetNntp Posting Host  scws7.harvard.eduLines  37shirriff sprite.berkeley.edu  Ken Shirriff  writes  It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional  since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained. Imagine archiving all pay phone conversations  so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer  you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And archive calls to from suspected Mafia members  potential terrorists  radicals  etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year.Imagine if this were available during the 1992 elections  instead ofclumsily searching through the Clinton passport file  they could have just done a  voice grep   as someone stated earlier  on his telephoneconversations for the last 10 years.Im not a lawyer and I dont even play one on TV  but intuitively theressomething wrong with having ones words archived for possible futureuse against you.

PPE  writes    Are you aware that there is an arms embargo on all of what is was   Yugoslavia  including Bosnia  which guarantees massive military   superiority of Serbian forces and does not allow the Bosnians to   try to defend themselves    Should we sell weapons to all sides  or just the losing one  then    Ending an embargo does not _we_ must sell anything at all.Right.  Well probably end up giving them weapons.  If the Europeans want to sell weapons to one or both sides  they are welcome  as far as Im concerned.   You seem to oppose ending the embargo.  You know  it is difficult for Europeans to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place.During WWII  the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despiteGerman occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besidessponsoring peace conferences  they would have no problem putting any kind ofweapon they wanted into Bosnia.I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a lawforbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia  including via thirdparties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more activerole would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor inthe outcome of the war.  I do not automatically accept the argument that Bosnia is any worse than  other recent civil wars  say Vietnam for instance.  The difference is it is  happening to white people inside Europe  with lots of TV coverage.   But if this was the reason  and if furthermore both sides are equal  wouldnt all us racist Americans be favoring the good Christians  Serbs  instead of the non Christians we really seem to favor Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And thatsabout all we have to go on  isnt it   And I wish youd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levelsat which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level  youdo not have to consciously recognize the racial element   you simply tend toempathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferringChristian over Moslem  I am an atheist myself  and I think youll agree thatin the US  the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis ofreligion  nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

I figure that the plotter is worth about  300 and the pens are worth atleast another  200 more..  One thing is certain  you wont need topurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens weresealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem tofunction as well.    Id be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested injust them.

They had more than 40 days to come       out and get their trial.  They chose to keep the children with them and       to stay inside.  They chose to stay inside even after they were tear   gassed.      I do not find these actions rational.  Even Noriega was smart enough to       give up and go for the trial he deserved.              Mr. Roby  you are a government sucking heartless bastard.        Unworthy of comment.  But apparently true.  My opinion  only  of course.So  your opinion is truth.  I see...         Humans died      yesterday  humans who would not have died if the FBI had not taken the     actions      they did.  That is the undeniable truth.  I cried for them.        Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty.   That is undeniable truth.    No  it is not.  It is possible the FBI planned for this to happen  and the   gunfire heard was the FBI keeping the folks inside.  Im not proposing this as   the way it went down  but just to point out that its not  undeniable  that if   they walked out yesterday  they would be alive today.You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable  however  that people have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse  you can not say undeniably that there wouldnt have been a mass suicide if the FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   My heart bleeds just as much as yours for    the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities    to do so.  My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion    to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up    and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning.  My heart  bleeds  for no one.  You are the  bleeding heart .  And Im sure   beyond any possible doubt that you do not feel for those people as I do.  You   can not say the heartless things you have said if you did.I am the heartless bleeding heart   You are not making sense.You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless to me.I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadnt stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me sad and sick.    You seem to say      they got what they deserved.      I do not think this.  However  if they did set the fire  which started in    more than one place and spread very quickly   then they got what they    wanted and put into motion themselves.   they got what they wanted .  What kind of creature are you that you can   believe this Have you ever heard of Jonestown The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority worshipers and their only authority was Koresh Howell.   If these people were able to think for themselves  there would likely be a lot more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as last year.   I see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept. and likely    by Arlen Spectre and congress.  This is good.  They have bungled the affair    from the start.  We agree on this.  Now lets have your God  the FBI  investigated  too.By all means  the FBI should be investigated  too.  BTW  I thought the second ammendment was God.         Jim          jmd handheld.com

a request,"Organization  is a nice thing...Lines  28Having read the various  Clipper  announcements on the net over the last few days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip  its uses government plots  etc  I have the following questions.  1  What does the  Clipper chip  actually implement  Just the Skipjack	cryptographic algorithm  Or does it also implement a  chip to chip 	communications protocol  If it does implement a communications	protocol  can it be used as just a  crypt chip  also.  2  Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained   3  Who may purchase them and under what conditions   4  Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system   5  The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does	not appear to require that the  Family key  be a secret.

Joe Robbie Stadium  NOT FOR BASEBALL ,"Reply To  iacs3650 oswego.Oswego.EDU  Kevin Mundstock Organization  Instructional Computing Center  SUNY at Oswego  Oswego  NYLines  16Did anyone notice the words  NOT FOR BASEBALL  printed on the pictureof Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USAToday  Any reason given for this Also  I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline inthe preview. On 8 22 89  Rickey Henderson became Nolans 5000th strikeout.On 6 11 90 he pitched his 6th no hitter against Oakland. I believe thelast out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5 1 91  Nolanpitched his 7th no hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his939th base  which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot ofpublicity at Rickeys expense. IMO  Rickey deserves it  and it seems asmost of the net agrees with me from what Ive seen on it lately. They areboth great players  but IMO  Nolan has outclassed Rickey  both in playingand more importantly  in attitude. Just my thoughts.						Kevin"

So we ought to make beating up a homosexual more illegal than beating up a straight   Silly me  thinking that the issue was that we are all people  to be treated equally.  Thanks for straightening me out.                              Wrong  if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straightbashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloodyfuck out of him  they would get charged as well under all the federal lawsthat exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent ishis sexual orientation  and so the law applies to them as well. Thenational government retains the right to make any laws necessary tosufficiently deter and punish any crime against someones civil rightsuntil that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it The fact is  that at last count  gays were not beating straights for theirsexual orientation. Thus  the law is getting applied only to the straightswho indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the rightto enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law evenif it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them.

I think what you meant to say here was   With the current mutation of the US Constitution under the current police state  someone may be charged multiple times for one act if the victim in question is of the right shade.   A single act should never merit more than on charge.  Thats almost like if four cops got acquitted from cruel and unusual punishment charges  and the country went and tried them again and again until they... oh.... never mind.

Washington Post Article on SSF Redesign,News Software  VAX VMS VNEWS 1.41    Nntp Posting Host  tm0006.lerc.nasa.govOrganization  NASA Lewis Research Center   Cleveland  OhioLines  52 Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May BeImpossible Today  4 6  the Washington Post ran an article with theheadline shown above. The article starts with  A leaderof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the plannedspace station said yesterday the job is tough and maybe impossible.  OConnor is quoted saying whether it ispossible to cut costs that much and still provide formeaningful research  is a real question for me. OConnor said  everything is fair game   including dropping or curtailing existing contracts with theaerospace industry  chopping management of the spacestation program at some NASA facilities around thecountry  working closely with the Russian space stationMir  and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement themanned space shuttle fleet. OConnor says his team has reviewed 30 design optionsso far  and they are sorting the serious candidatesinto three categories based on cost.The Post says OConnor described the design derivedfrom the current SSF as a high cost option  I believeKathy Sawyer  the Post writer  got confused here. Ilistened in on part of OConnors briefing to the presson Monday  and in one part of the briefing OConnortalked about how the White House wants three options sorted by cost  low  medium  and high . In another partof the briefing  he discussed the three teams he hasformed to look at three options  SSF derivative   LaRC modular buildup with Bus 1   MSFC  and Single LaunchCore   wingless Orbiter     JSC. Later  in response toa reporters question  I thought I heard OConnor saythe option based on a SSF redesign was a  moderate cost option  in between low   high cost options. Notthe  high cost  option as Sawyer wrote .The article goes on to describe the other two optionsas  one features modules that could gradually be fittedtogether in orbit  similar to the Russian Mir. Theother is a core facility that could be deposited inorbit in a single launch  like Skylab. That optionwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle  the fuselage  for example  in its basic structure. The last sentence in the article contradicts the title  the first paragraph. The sentence reads  He OConnor  said a streamlined version of the plannedspace station Freedom is still possible within theadministrations budget guidelines.

The vast majority get through life without ever having to  	own  use or display a firearm.            You might have missed the U.S. News   World Report excerpt  I posted.  It is fairly consistant with other such polls  finding  that approximately 40 50  of households have at least one firearm.  How this translates into individual ownership is questionable  but I  think its fairly safe to say that youre wrong about the  vast majority. 	OK ... a near majority actually OWN firearms  but I will still	claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even	threaten anyone with them. What do they do right ... or are	they just lucky   In either case  this means the average	threat level in this country is rather low.           Besides  there are other  	means of self protection which can be just as effective  	as firearms.            Please name them.  The key phrase is  can be.   Theories are  nice  but practicality is more important.  A taser  to chose an  exmpale outlawed virtually everywhere   can  be as effective as a gun   under optimal conditions when dealing with your absolute average   ... 	I think you have weapons on the brain. I never said that these	alternative means of self protection involved any hardware.	Why are good neighborhoods good   It isnt because every	person is armed to the teeth. It is because of  1  attitude	and  2  cooperation. In the good neighborhoods  the residents	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when	strangers are lurking around. Good neighborhoods form groups	like crime watch to increase this effect  and the relative	effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested  the	good neighbors step up and say  THATS the one officer   He	was robbing Mr. Jones house . 	In short  the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.	Replace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a	block party.     Freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion  necessity  or    scientific scrutiny.    	New to this planet   EVERYTHING is dependent on either public  	or political opinion  usually political. To imagine that  	inalienable rights are somehow wired into the vast cold  	cosmos is purest egotism and a dangerous delusion.           In a very real sense  everything  the government does is based  on public approval  if for no other reason than at any particular time  there arent  public servants  commonly adorning trees.           But legality and legitimacy also matter.  If a governments charter  makes a rule  which the government then violates  it is violated the  basis for its existance.  Enforcement of its will becomes a matter  solely of force of arms.	Oliver North. The man is positively worshiped in many	all American conservative quarters. He and Big Ron	set up a secret government and did all sorts of severely	illegal deeds   the kind of stuff you and I would be doing	twenty to life for  yet he walks free. This BS happens all	the time. In fact  it happens so much that no one really	cares anymore.  Legitimacy is a non issue. Legality is	a non issue. So long as we get T bones and our MTV  who	gives a rats ass       No arguments against RKBA can withstand scientific scrutiny.    	They dont have to. Like so many other things  the issue  	is one of  perception  rather than boring statistics.           Excuse me  sir  but  you  were the one suggesting that arguments  for RKBA would not stand up to scientific scrutiny.	No. I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical	aspects of the argument. Pure emotion  like the abortion issue.  	Every time some young innocent is gunned down in a drive  	by  every time some kid is murdered for a jacket  every  	time a store clerk is executed for three dollars in change   	every time some moron kills his wife because she took the  	last beer from the fridge  every time someone hears a bang  	in the night .... the RKBA dies.             Emotion is hard to argue against.  But it must be done anyway if  emotion is wrong.	Argue away ... you cant win.          The stats are not all  that   	clearly behind firearms               And just yesterday you claimed they werent behind them at  all.           the protection factor does not  	strongly outweigh the mindless mayhem factor.             Operating under the assumption that the same conditions absolutely  govern both of them.  That the expansion of one automatically necessitates  the contraction of the other.	Firearms related mindless mayhem will be related to the	availibility of firearms. If they become scarce and 	and expensive  a different psychology will take hold.	I  think  they would be used far less to settle trivial	complaints. "

I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp  but Id like to have this box not be active.Sure  youve already got the right idea.Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second  justrun it into  say  a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out1 100 of the original voltage  and has an output impedence of negligiblyless than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a littledepending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio orthe availability of parts.Hows that sound 					   Joel KolstadP.S.    This is why those 1000 1 high voltage probes for multimeters can beaccurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with100k  which doesnt load the  often high impedence  source much  as well askeeping the  probably 10 meg impedance  multimeter happy."

The lies from ATF say  holes were made in the walls and non lethal tear gas pumped in . A few minutes after this started the whole thing went up. ALL buildings are aflame. NO ONE HAS ESCAPED. I think it obvious that the ATF used armored flame thrower vehicles to pump in unlit napalm  then let the wood stove inside ignite it.Actually if a few minutes translates into 6 hours  you have itright.  BUT you  and I guess your single source news agency CNN failed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plainview.

How to detect use of an illegal cipher ,"Nntp Posting Host  vccnw03.its.rpi.eduOrganization  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Troy  NYLines  47In article  betel.734997645 camelot  betel camelot.bradley.edu  Robert Crawford  writes  Jay Fenton  Fenton Kaleida.Com  writes    How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without  being able to decode the traffic  i.e.  In order to accuse me of using an  unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both  keys out of escrow  run them against my ciphertext and  draw a blank .  	I was thinking about this  also. Its quite possible the system transmits  in clear  the serial number of the device being used. That way they can start a tap  get the serial number  and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key.  	If they tap someone whos apparently using encryption  but dont find that prefix  then theyll assume its an  un authorized  encryption scheme.From the limited details released so far  It seems that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise  the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes placeat the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in their data base This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP   RSADSI. The former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while makingchip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the fedsare forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break RSAs stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying toban strong crypto  they are trying to co opt it. Their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the keyregistration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likelyis that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q A session  theytalk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization butcarefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or well ban strong crypto outright I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all  legal  wayspossible.Bill Smythe"

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN 14000 right now.So its an automatic  Dont know if US spec CDN spec. for Maximas. The car has 96000 km  or about 60000 miles  on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km  or about 43K mi . The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.   He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.   Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars  I dont know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items  Or is this an indication that the car was abused If it is the first set of brake pads on front  then this is fine. My careats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing themuffler too is also ok. Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon The mileage is fairly low   but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Checkthe maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valveadjustments  timing belt changes and so on.The 60k mile service is often expensive  so make sure he has done everything. The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot  but  I dont know how to verify this...  Ive seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood  though. Well  this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying acar with highway miles. Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires hehas been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets a hard driven car 6 10 sets. Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept  its currently out of warranty  a similarly priced 90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left  and I dont want to worry about paying for any repair bills...Well  the Maxima should be pretty reliable   but if its out of warrantyyou should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stufffor Japanese cars can be expensive. But  I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out  by the way 1995 model year  I believe.

However the calculations are mathematically highly complex  and must assume that theobjects hole projects an image  resembling an ellipse if the tube is notparallel to the screen  in the centre of the screen.  However  it is unlikelythat the object is placed so conveniently.  Firstly  we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannotknow what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume thatthey are parallel to do the transformation   How do I do this transformation Secondly  there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar the source  screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of thescreen .  How can I compensate the ellipses axis for this image distortion So  please can anyone give us a few pointers here   How do we transform theimage so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen  and howdo I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen Wed appreciate any help  either posted or emailed.Thanks in advance  Simon.

Rodney Jacks   rjacks austlcm.sps.mot.com The CD300  external  is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  now.  Demand for the units are high  so they are pretty rare.

Has anybody had any experience with this board  good or bad   Any information would be helpful  thanks Brian J SchaufenbuelI believe that any VL EISA ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipsetis limited to 24 bit EISA DMA  where real EISA DMA is 32 bit .  TheHINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For thisreason I would pass.  I own one of these  HAWK VL EISA ISA  and am look ing to replace it for exactly this reason.Please double check me on this.  In other words  call the motherboardmanufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32 bit EISADMA.Other than this limitation  the motherboard works quite well  I am usingmine with DOS 5  Windows 3.1  and UNIX S5R3.2 .

There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do   any other graphics in Linux without X windows   I love Linux because it is   so easy to learn..  You want text   Okay.   Use Linux. You want text AND   graphics   Use Linux with X windows.  Simple.  Painless.  REQUIRED to have   X Windows if you want graphics   This includes fancy word processors like   doc  image viewers like xv  etc.   Sorry  Bryan  this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comeswith Linux SLS  It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode  without  Xwindows.So at least it is  possible  to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I dontthink that there exists a similar SVGA package  and viewing GIFs in 320x200 isnot very nice.Best Regards Arno                                                                                   Arno Schaefer				ENSIMAG  2e AnneeEmail  schaefer silene.imag.frTel.   33  76 51 79 95			                                                                                   "

My problem is that on some of our machines  running MS DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode   the SET command in the BAT file fails with the OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that I am nowhere near to running out.  From the Windows Resource Toolkit  for Win4Workgroups    add an entry toyour  system.ini  file under the  NonWindowsApp  section     CommandEnvSize NNNN This sets the COMMAND.COM env size  where NNNN must either be 0 orbetween 160 and 32768.  A value of 0 disables the setting.  If thisvalue is too small or too big  it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768.If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled  as if it were 0.  If you specify theenvironment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM  the PIF settingoverrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlierthan 3.2.  Otherwise  the default value is the  e  option in theSHELL  command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value  you must edit yourSYSTEM.INI  and reboot . I have used this entry  as well as relied on the default  e  fromthe CONFIG.SYS shell  line  and both give larger environments.  Ifyou dont use one of these  then the environment passed by windowsto each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment_variables_ present when windows was started.   No matter how bigthe DOS env was  when windows starts  it truncates all unused spaceexcept for a few bytes.   This should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary.

RED SOX LEAD 8 0 AFTER 2      ,Organization  Cypress Semi  Beaverton ORLines  46In article  C56zrA.75n ulowell.ulowell.edu  stwombly cs.ulowell.edu  Steve Twombly  writes  The Boston Red Sox lead the KC Royals 8 0 after 2 innings.  The Sox are the only undefeated team in the AL East after 4 days.  GO JUMP IN THE LAKE YOU NON BELIEVERS                                 Steve As I have read this net the last few days  I am continually amazed at the pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it comes down to saying that the Bosox havent a prayer.  As a long time Red Soxfan  I will simply say   The Impossible Dream Year   1967 for those of youwith short memories. short lives  or both.  To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticismfrom those who only follow the hot team.  This statement is supported basedon the increased number of Brave Woofers out on the net.  A true fan of a team  any team  will follow that team through the good years as well as the leanyears  and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  Yeah  so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in  86.  Who cares ifClemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  Thefact is  they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fanssupported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times  the number of detracters come from all over.  So what   Let them play and we will see what happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good  but they are certainly not that bad  either and they do have a chance to win the World Series  after all remember the  69 Mets   Who would have given them a chance to even make it thatfar  let alone beat Baltimore.Lets face it  Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Footballand Basketball.  Because of this  one can never say with absolute certainity whatthe outcome will be over the course of 162 games.                                                                                 joec godot.cyprs.rain.com      WARNING  Elvis impersonating can be hazardous   joec ursula.ee.pdx.edu                  to your health    it sure wont help                                           your reputation.

guns in backcountry  no thanks,"Nntp Posting Host  beethoven.cs.colostate.eduOrganization  Colorado State University  Computer Science DepartmentLines  27  Hmm  wouldnt manditory saftey classes  registration  of both the owner and gun  and manditory liability insurance be nice for  gun owners.         The two are not the same  as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for  use on public property  and  making rules for ownership .         The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country  and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled  never funded  or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York  Chicago  and California have been used for confiscation.   Many  gun owners would  in theory  support these planes.   Although the numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem  that intentional misuse is .  Theyve simply seen it abused and are leery of the next person who comes down the pike with a  reasonable  suggestion theyve already seen abused.Gun safety classes sound good in theory  but they kind of remind me ofthe  literacy tests  used in the bad old days to keep blacks from voting.They came with the  grandfather clause   if your grandfather could vote you could vote.  Sort of like the gun safety laws that only let thepolitical ass kissers have guns.						Doug Holland"

The Orioles  Red Sox  and Yankeesall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially theexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldnt have surprisedanybody.  Meanwhile  as predicted  the Mariners dropped behind theAngels and Royals.  They clearly didnt deserve the 22 33 record inJune.  The White Sox and As upped their game a bit  while the Twinsdropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.Okay  so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictivecalculation  I thought this did pretty well.                                                                               1. The Braves insert Kent Mercker into the starting rotation sometime this year  1992 .  Bielecki is traded or released  Lei  brandt becomes the fifth starter  and the best bullpen in baseball has Pena  Berenguer  Stanton  Wohlers  Freeman  and Pete Smith  who spot starts as well.Hm.  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker.  And Bieleckiwasnt released until the end of the year.  I wont comment on thebullpen.   Jeff Reardon         2. Blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end of May.  Bream goes on the DL  and Klesko goes on a nice hitting honeymoon  a la Gregg Jefferies in 1988  platooning with Hunter. Mitchell wins the center field job a bit later  All Star break   and Nixon stays on as a valuable pinch runner.  Lonnie is released unless the Braves find a taker in a trade.Right on Blauser.  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early onLonnie  as with Bielecki.  Didnt pick Sanders.   Did anybody      3. Managers to be fired this year  1992  in chronological order  Fregosi  Showalter  Valentine  RiddochThree of them went  right   Showalter is still around  and likely tostick  it seems .                                                                               1  Bonds gets traded from Bucs for some young talent.Nope   They won the division  and so kept him for a shot at theplayoffs. 2  Mets win division     Well  they didnt finish last. 3  Atlanta repeats in the WestGot that one right. 4  Yankees surprise everyone  but finish second behind Toronto.Nope. 5  Dwight Gooden wins 20  but is surpassed by Saberhagen who wins 22.I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win  huh  6  Roger Clemens is injured early in the season.Tsk Tsk.  Not nice to predict something like this. 7  Strawberry fails to hit even 20 home runs and is often injured. 8  Due to 7  Dodgers drop out of race.You got that right                                                                               And my response... From tedward Tue Mar 31 17 57 42 1992  Hmph   Can tell you are a Mets fan   Do you mind if I make some counter predictions against yours   They follow  2  Mets come in third  behind Pittsburgh and Montreal.Okay  so the Mets finished fifth.  But I got the Pirates and Exposright  4  The Yankees offense and pitching flounders  dropping them to fourth    place in the AL East.  Boston wins 95 games  the division  the pennant     and the World Series.First half   Dead on   Second half   Ummm....  Im a Sox fan  go easyon me  5  Dwight Gooden rushes his comeback  gets blown out  and goes on the DL from    May through mid July.    Saberhagen runs a .500 record  WFAN criticizes the Mets for  giving away    that great talent Jefferies   who has a solid year in KC.So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed.       Iwas at least  close   and was right about Jefferies.   Though I dontknow.  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade   6  Roger Clemens wins another CY  as well as 20 games.Close.  No cigar.

Something is wrong with that projection.Some predictions need no introduction                                                                                    Do you care to put your prediction down for posterity   You predict  Mark Grace will get 90  RBIs.  I say you are out of your mind.  That  is almost impossible for a 10 HR type guy batting behind Dawson.   Who  kills most of the rallies he doesnt finish.   	Why do you say that  Mark has driven in 82  90  and 79  89 . Last year Mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year average wise. Since he is batting either 3rd or 5th this year I predict  he will be back up to his previous standards  I think he will be better  90 rbis is not that much of a stretch.Sometimes us statheads get lucky.  Grace  didnt  hit behind Dawsonthe entire season  but he also finished with only 79 RBIs.                                                                                 The most ballsy prediction ever   Mark McGwire will hit 61 or more HRs this year.Nope.  He slowed down  and the injury finished him off.  Didnteven reach 50.  But a ballsy prediction  nonetheless.                                                                                1  Baltimore will not fade.  They will not win the division this year      but they will finish within five games.  I find the prospect of two     Orioles winning 20 each easier to comprehend than that of two Sox.     No offense   I think their pitching is about as good as the division     has to offer.The Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20  thoughMussina might have had a chance  with better relief and more starts .  2  Nobody else in the division is worth a darn.  They all finish a minimum     of fifteen games out  the Tribe 30.  Thats another reason to watch     Baltimore this year and next   they wont waste many of those games      against the rest of the division.Except for the Brewers  who you probably forgot   you were right   Therest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians led  with 76 wins  the Red Sox  trailed  with 73 wins.  None werehorrible  but four were five or more games below .500.                                                                              Date  Thu  6 Aug 1992 15 47 30 GMT Right.  That was me.  I never said the Jays were a cinch to clinch it but I said that Milwaukee will be more of a threat than Baltimore.  I do think that Toronto should win it but after 87 I dont consider anything a cinch unless you have something like a 4 game lead with 3 games to go.  I do think that the Jays have the best talented team in the AL East and if we had a good  or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right now.  I also think that the Orioles will not play much better than .500 baseball for the rest of the season.You win                                                                                 In article  1991Nov13.060413.9187 cs.cornell.edu  you write   7. Indians	the first and only 0 162 season ever        Prediction   The Cleveland indians will win 70 or more games next year.You were right                                                                                 1. Jose Rijo will win the 1992 Cy Young award IF he is healthy enough to go at least 210 IP.  Who would have thought he would try to steal a base  Why risk such an injury    He had 211 IP  but didnt win the Cy Young.  Maddux surprised all. 2. The Orioles will win 88  games in at least 3 of the next 6 years  probably the last 3  and their pitching staff will have a team ERA among the best 4 in the AL in at least 3 of the next 6 years  but not necessarily all the same years as they win 88  . This one will take a long time to verify.I dont think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games lastyear  and they were fifth in the league in ERA.  Not a bad start. 4. Ben McDonald will not challenge for an ERA title in the next 2 years  nor will he have 18  victories either year.  By challenge  I mean FINISH among the leaders  being among the leaders BEFORE the season is done doesnt count.   He will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be  but is still a decent starter to have.Looks like it.  He wasnt bad last year  just too consistent to be anace.  So far this year looks like more of the same. 5. The Phillies will give up  many  fewer walks if when they get rid of their bullpen coach  Ryan .  I am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him  and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust  before seeing the radical change. They would have a fine pitching staff if  they would just steal Ray Miller away from Pittsburg. The White Sox seem to have the same problem  but not as bad. I honestly cant say.  Did they get rid of him   Their BB totals weredown last year. 7. Ricky Jordan will have 90  rbi IF he starts 145  games  hitting in the 3 or 4 or 5 spot in any lineup or the 6 spot in a lineup with very good OBP in the 4 5 hitters. This applies for each of the next 3 years.I just dont think hes that good.... 12. Billy Ripken will  never  again hit over .240 with 400  AB.     So far  so good.  Im  definitely  not waiting to check this one.                                                                                 No matter what Lou Gorman and his scouts say  Paul Quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league starter.  Never    I have never seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out 3 per 9 innings at AAA be successful in the majors. Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief.  He has arubber arm and unusual delivery.  He might be decent in that role.                                                                                      M.V.P.    92 A.L.   Frank Thomas N.L.

Belle will hit more HR than he has walks in 1992.Belle hit 34 HR last year  walking 52 times  but five of those wereintentional  .  Okay  so I exaggerate.  But I  might  have been right.                                                                                  Are the Os going to sign Cal  of is Elis wallet welded shut  outgoing    money only  wide open for incoming cash 8     My prediction  which you may make note of  Valentine        is that Eli Jacobs will defer any serious negotiations on Cal Ripkens contract until the 92 season is over.  Eli will give Cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble a bit from last years pace before coming forth with an offer.   Despite claims that OP CY was designed to Cals strength  my feeling is that the 411 foot left center  canyon  will cut down on Cals power stats.   After all  its hard to credibly to offer  3 4 million year to an All Star game MVP AL MVP Gold Glove shortstop baseball deity        but itd be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an  obviously declining but above average  shortstop who had a career year one full season ago.  Of course  if Cal  does  match his 91 numbers  then Eli is going to be faced with a rather huge  and expensive  problem...How much did Cal sign for   When did he sign   If I remembercorrectly  he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season.                                                                              And finally....  Generally  because of expansion in 1993  there will be a lot of mediocre talent hanging around. Much of it will not make it  as the expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their teams. My specific predictions   As of April 7  1993   Jim Acker and Cory Snider will be selling aluminum siding.Snyder is still in SF.  Acker is gone   Neither Charlie Kerfeld nor Vance Lovelace  presently in Tiger AA but formerly big leaguers  will be playing professional ball.They arent in the majors. Nor will Dave Rozema  who says hes keeping in shape with a hope for another shot with expansion .Never heard of him. Shawn Hare and Jody Hurst will be in the major leagues.  They are outfielders in the Tiger minor league system I dont  think  they are in the majors. Ron Hassey will be a minor league manager with the Yankees.Dunno what happened to him. It will be bye bye for Balboni.If hes still around  hes stuck in the minors. Bo Jackson will _not_ be a starter.Hm.  With Raines out  Bo looks to get a lot of PT. Gary Huckaby will have moved to Alaska permanently  theyre on the net        and Dave Kirsch will return to Canada to live.Hm.

 EFF  Initial EFF Analysis of Clinton Privacy and Security Proposal,Organization  University of Illinois  Dept. of Comp. Sci.  Urbana  ILLines  107 An article from comp.org.eff.news  EFFector Online 5.06   Carl                        April 16  1993      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY                             PROPOSAL       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues posed by new technology.       However  EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry  before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently  the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency. The so called  Clipper Chip  is an 80 bit  split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users keys  and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified  but they chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .       First  the Administration appears to be adopting a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA developed Clipper chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore  we should not rely on the government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.       Second  an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent  expert scrutiny.         Third  while the use of the split key  dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs  the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys   Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive individuals fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries          In sum  the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However  the  Clipper chip  solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry  not be adopted before the discussion even begins.DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL ESCROWThe 80 bit key will be divided between two escrow agents  each of whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid warrant  the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested one non law enforcement federal agency  perhaps the Federal Reserve  and one non governmental organization.  But  there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the communications device.  A key is tied to the device  not to the person using it.CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORSThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this  Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star crypto cracker team to come in  under a security arrangement  and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVERIn order to get a market moving  and to show that the government believes in the security of this system  the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI  Secret Service  VP Al Gore  and maybe even the President. FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT Jerry Berman  Executive DirectorDaniel J.

Booting from B drive,Organization  MicroTech SoftwareLines  34glang slee01.srl.ford.com  Gordon Lang  writes  David Weisberger  djweisbe unix.amherst.edu  wrote    I have a 5 1 4  drive as drive A.  How can I make the system boot from   my 3 1 2  B drive    Optimally  the computer would be able to boot   from either A or B  checking them in order for a bootable disk.  But   if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that   it cant boot 5 1 4  disks  thats OK.  Also  boot_b wont do the trick   for me.       Thanks      Davebo We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway.  I finally got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives.  The only reason I didnt do it in the first place was because I had several bootable 5 1 4s and some 5 1 4 based install disks which expected the A drive.  I order all new software  and upgrades  to be 3 1 2 and the number of  stupid  install programs that cant handle an alternate drive are declining with time   the ones I had are now upgraded.  And as for the bootable 5 1 4s I just cut 3 1 2 replacements. If switching the drives is not an option  you might be able to wire up a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I havent tried it but I think it would work as long as it is wired carefully.I did this.  I use a relay  Radio Shack 4PDT  instead of a hugeswitch.  This way  if the relay breaks  my drives will still work.It works fine  but you may still need to change the CMOS before thedrive switch will work correctly for some programs.rp93   Roger C.

It     is also where the high bandwidth comes from  and the fantastic     image  and the large image size  etc  etc...    Its also where the two annoying lines across the screen  one a third  down  the other two thirds down  come from.  The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube  these2 wires will be found on all 17  trinitron tubes  e.g.  Mitsubishi 17  Sony 1604  etc .  On 14  Sony tubes  youll find one wire.Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  Im so happy with thesharpness of the T560i that I dont even notice the lines.The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which  when viewed as a complete tube has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in a flatter screen than other 17  monitors using the standard trinitron  which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface   and apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.                                                    .

Watch out for that darned  convertible tan  tho...      i simply must inquire  how can people honestly consider this car  a  convertible    Does Porsche have a patent on the  targa  name   I mean  convertible to me means  top down   which the del Sol certainly  does NOT do.  It has the center that lifts out.  This is what i would  term a targa unless Porsches was gonna sue me for doing that .  I know  the rear window rolls down  but i still can hardly consider this car  to be a convertible.  Yes  however  with the top off and the rear window down this car is more like a convertible than a coupe.  Think of it as a convertible with an integrated roll bar like addition.jp

Radar detector DETECTORS ,Organization  At UT  Thats a joke.Lines  24NNTP Posting Host  thing1.cc.utexas.eduIt is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors orpolice monitors  are essentially making the claim that there is noother reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courtshave sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdictionand sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not haveenough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besidesavoiding law enforcement action for speeding.When you buy a radar detector  amongst the guarrantees  instructions  explanations  and other detritus  is an invitation to join anassociation dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector. I promise I am not making this up  I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fundraiser aspect of tickets.

We ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away near the store. Well at first we didnt know what was happening  and then afellow I know comes up to me  an Azerbaijani guy  and says   What are youstanding here for  Go home immediately   I asked   Whats going on   He says   Whats the matter  cant you see  theyve overturned a car and theyre killing Armenians   He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard. But the neighbors wouldnt let them in the building. There were about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. Theywere shouting something  but you couldnt understand it. It wasnt one voice or two  all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.They went up to the third _floor  and we see that theyre breaking glass and throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway  one has a pair of jeans in his hands  another has a tape recorder  and a third a guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School No. 33  which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only known Ernest before  he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani guard at the school let us in. At first he didnt want to  but there was nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We were told that on that day  the 1st  there would be an attack on our microdistrict.We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could beused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. Iasked him for assistance. I say   Were in School No. 33  we need to be evacuated.  Well he says   Got it  wait there  Im sending out help now. I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant  I had spoken withhim personally. When I called he said   Muslimzade here. About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked outthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying   Armenians  come out  were here to get you.  They have clubs  axes  and armature shafts in their hands. The guard sat there with us  and asked   Where should I go   I say   If your life is of any value to you youll go down there and say that the Armenians were here and that they left.  Thats what he did. He went down there and said   The Armenians were here   he said   I let them out the back door  they went that way.  And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help  all right Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive thatMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school  no one knew that we were there. In any case  we stayed at the school until seven in the morning  and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.In the morning we went to my relatives in Microdistrict 1  and the soldiers took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people  and there were lots of people ahead of us  there was no space available. One small boy  about three months old  died right in my arms. There wasnt a single doctor  nothing. The boy was uninjured  there were no wounds or bruises on him. He wasjust very ill. They gave him mouth to mouth resuscitation  they did everythingthey could under the circumstances  but were unable to save him. And his mother and father  a young Armenian couple  were right there  on the floor ...I searched for a spot for us in the SK  we have a small child of our own  Iwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the thirdfloor  there were a lot of soldiers up there  bandaged  with canes  limping  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys  all of them.There were a lot of bandaged Armenians  too. Everyone had been beaten  everyone was crying  wailing  and calling for help. I think that the CityParty Committee ignored us completely. True  there was a snack bar  a sausage was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks  a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was beingsold for 50  a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to get the things any cheaper.I met my old uncle  Aram Mikhailovich  there. He saw me and tears welled up inhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples  that we worked together  he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw me and there was nothing he could say  he just cried. You can understand his feelings  of course.

New Home for the Bosox   ,Organization  Skidmore College  Saratoga Springs NYLines  19  I agree  though Id also be happy with a stadium that looks  like new Comiskey.

While were on the multipurpose subject  lets not forget Shea  whichwas designed to accommodate both the Mets   Jets.  It was the firststadium  I think  to have the box seats on rollers so they could beoriented at right angles for baseball   in parallel for football.Of course  with the Jets gone to Jersey  and a truly good footballstadium   the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular  the seats are almost always too far from theaction.

In my opinion  if you want to have other people logging in and running  applications at your pc  youll want to have a 486 33 with 16 Megs of RAM.  Also  the Xwindows software in DESQviewX really seems to like an ET 4000   TSENG Labs chipset  based graphics card. Personally  I found that things  ran better with a SCSI drive in the pc than with ESDI drives  but that is  my experience only  What sort of traffic is generated with the X calls   I am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running DV X is supporting multiple users  clients  and we require adequate response time.  Anyone have any ideas     I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine  not the networkitself. To give you a real world example  here at Quarterdeck we haveroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes  novellfile servers  and each other. Its not _too_ much of a load on ourEthernet  with maybe 4 concentrators  so you have 20 30 people on eachsegment . If you had a badly loaded net  or the apps you wanted to runwere very network intensive  you could run into some slowdowns.But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 48633 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have10 people running programs off it  youre going to see some slowdownsbecause youre now on  effectively  a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course  DVX willattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their timeslice  but if you have 10 working programs running  youll know it.Having said that  if you can tweak the programs being run  by addingin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort ofthing   you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine beforeyou started seeing slowdowns again  this time from network bandwidth .It all really depends on what the programs are doing  ie. youre goingto see a slowdown from X bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are alldoing network things also...

Around the age of 10 she had some gynecological problems.  Now shes  in her early mid twenties and she is going blind.   Her eyes are not producing enough  if any  moisture.  Shes been going  to Mass Eye and Ear and the doctors there have no clue what the actual  cause is.  THey have apparently tried eyedrops and such.  She is just  about completely blind in one eye and the other is massively  deteriorated.Sjogrens syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as wellas induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could bedue to a complication of Sjogrens known as pseudolymphoma which  can  producea splenomegaly  enlarged spleen . She should definitely see a rheumatologist.Since you dont mention skin disorder  anemia  or joint pain youd probablyrule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma.Joshbackon VMS.HUJI.AC.IL   Also  and this may or may not be related  she is having some changes  in her abdomen.  her stomach has swelled  im not sure if this is  stomach the organ or stomach teh area of the body .   I guess the step theyre going to take next is to do a whole battery  of tests to check all the other internal systmes besides just the  eyes...   but just because the net is a source of large amounts of bizarre  knowledge  im going to ask  has anyone ever heard of anything like  this   suggestions of things to ask about  since much of my knowledge  about her state comes second or third hand     Thanks.

ESDI is always 1.25MB s  although there are some non standard versions The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI SCSI I  8 bit asynchronous   1.5MB s ave   synchronous  5MB s max  transfer base.SCSI 1 faster  this requires a SCSI 2 controller chip and provides SCSI 2  8 bit to 16 bit  speeds with SCSI 1 controlers.SCSI 2  4 6MB s with 10MB s burst 8 bit   8 12MB s with 20MB s burst  16 bit   and 15 20MB s with 40MB s burst 32 bit wide and fast .  16 bit SCSI can bewide or fast  it depends on how the port is designed The Quadras will supportfast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since theQuardas use a SCSI 1  non wide  port .The article in PC Mag 4 27 93 29 was talking about SCSI 1  SCSI 2 usesTEN  10  devices in it native mode  outside its native mode it behaves alot like SCSI 1  7 devices  slower through put From your own figures SCSI 1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed outas for  20  faster then IDE  that seems to be 8 bit SCSI 1 using a SCSI 2 contoler chip  The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI 2 controler chip for its SCSI 1and gets 6MB s through put for asynchronous  8 bit  SCSI 1  far in excess of anormal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI 1 output  120  of 8.3 is 9.96 which is nearthe burst of a SCSI 1 machine with a SCSI 2 controller chip.The PC world seems to have SCSI 1 and SCSI 2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI 2 controler chips allow near SCSI 2 speeds through a SCSI 1 device As shown in the Mac Quadra  which skews some of the data of SCSI 1 vsIDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the  20 faster then IDE  came off a SCSI 1 device with a SCSI 2 chip.  Maybe itwas there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing withSCSI 1 NOT SCSI 2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI 1 devicewith a SCSI 2 controller chip.SCSI 1 chips are limited to 5 MB max.  SCSI 1 devices with SCSI 2 chips becoming common  produce up to 10Mb s in 8 bit mode and 20MB s in 16 bitmode  the fast version  SCSI 1 ports cannot use wide SCSI .  Of courcethe prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI 1 devices HAVE SCSI 2 chips or more accurately the machine does . This allows the best of BOTHworlds  high SCSI 2 speeds and cheeper SCSI 1 costs  FULL SCSI 2 hardware port  electronic controller  etc  is VERY expensive.  It ALSO createsa logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI 1 goes.When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that thearticle knows what it is talking about  even if it does not tell HOW thefigures came about  while  DXB132 psuvm.psu.edu is throwing outranges that dont tell SQUAT  Since he IGNORES SCSI 1 devices withSCSI 2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.

The cost would probably be similar  especially if we just   implanted some sort of electronic device.  Why wait until they commit the crime   Why not implant such devices in  potential criminals like Communists and atheists  Sorry  I dont follow your reasoning.  You are proposing to punish people  before  they commit a crime   What justification do you have for this No  Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism  not treating theelectronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is thatthe next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potentialcriminals.  This may not  on the surface  sound like a bad thing  but whodefines what a potential criminal is  If the government of the day decidesthat being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminalthen openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice  this is notconducive to a free society.Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon peopleis an impropriety upon that person  regardless of what type of crime orwhat chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justicesystem as a punishment for the offender and possibly  therefore  a deterrantto future offenders. Mathew sees it  most probably  as a means ofrehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you  okay Jeff.

A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different   dishes.  It didnt taste great  but I decided it wasnt so bad.  We went   home and went to bed early.

No one else got sick  and Im   not allergic to anything that I know of.        Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am    physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill  and that  is    a psycholgical reaction .  When I have been dragged in to suffer   through beef and broccoli without any sauces  I insist on no MSG.     I havent gotten sick yet.         I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly differentconclusion. Ive eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I wentwith some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they orderedlots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of thatmeal was the first course  scallops served in the shell with a soy type sauce.I thought   Well  Ive only had scallops once and I was sick after but thatcould have been a coincidence . That night as I sat on the bathroom floor sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way  I decided I would never touchanother scallop.

A question about 120V,Distribution  worldOrganization  Ozone Online Operations  Inc.  DBA The Ozone Hole BBSReply To  gerald.belton ozonehole.com  Gerald Belton  Lines  38  SO..  Heres my question.  It seems to me that Id have the  same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral jumper from the  neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding  outlets. Whats wrong with my reasoning here  First  go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of  Wiring Simplified  by H.L. Richter.  Now if your house is wired with metal conduit  you dont need a seperate ground wire  assuming the house is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water pipe in your basement .  The outlets that have a neutral hooked to the ground screw seem wrong.  Anyone else think so Back in the 70s I was a service technician for a cash register company.The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they wereVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggestproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.In almost every place we went to do an installation  we found outletswith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9  of the things youcan plug into one of these  they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare    line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will findthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal  itshould be o.k. for most applications.    . SLMR 2.1 . My reality check just bounced.

Bosox win again   the team record is 9 3 ,Organization  National Center for Atmospheric ResearchLines  31In article  jxu.735168686 black.clarku.edu   jxu black.clarku.edu  Dark Wing Duck    writes    Today  Frank Viola and rest of pitcher staff of Boston Red Sox shutout Chicago   White Sox 4 0.  It is Red Sox 9th win of this season.      So far  Red Sox won all the games Roger and Frank V. pitched  6 0  and 3 3   when other three starters were pitching.  Tomorrow  Dopson will pitch again    have a good first start and rocky second start .  I wonder that Bosox can   play over 500 ball without Roger and Frank V.   As long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox willplay better than .500 baseball.Or the Red Sox can hire former East German swimming coaches to train  them at the fine art of body  building . The Red Soxcan use Chinese women swimmers as a reference.With the  HAWK   the Red Sox definitely have a chance for theeast this year. He brings class  work ethic and leadership tothe park each day.

For this to work you need to stick some bits that an intruder cant guess in a file  readable only by you  which X client applications read. They pass the bits back to the server when they want to establish a connection.  ... What I settled on was grabbing a bunch of traffic off the network. Basically  I ran  	etherfind  u  x greater 0 compress  and skipped over 10K of output  then grabbed my bits. As best I can tell  these are bits that can be expected to be reasonably uniformly distributed  and quite unguessable by an intruder.For your application  what you can do is to encrypt the real time clockvalue with a secret key."

An Anecdote about Islam,Organization  sgiLines  15Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  solntze.wpd.sgi.comIn article  114127 bu.edu   jaeger buphy.bu.edu  Gregg Jaeger  writes       I dont understand the point of this petty sarcasm. It is a basic    principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says  I testify   that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God  that    so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one _must_   be considered muslim by all muslims. So the phenomenon youre attempting   to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic   Islamic principles. If you want to attack Islam you could do better than   than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts.Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committingbad acts  people temporarily become atheists jon.

Does Just justifiable War exist ,"Organization  University of OtagoLines  107Hi there netters I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on Is there such a thing as a justifible war  What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either   All war  is wrong   or  Some war is justifiable . To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  Zealand Cadet Forces  This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  it  but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training .  Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying  have become involved  in the sport of gliding  and have a great interest in military aviation  hardware as the very best a real flyer could ask for. My favourite  computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft  both  past and present. I became a Christian about 10 years ago  and at the time rejected all  military activity as immoral. For me  all war was in complete opposition  to Gods commandments to love one another  especially ones enemies.During the war in Iraq  I found myself with great excitement listening to  the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  technology I so admire   The F117A Stealh bomber  the F14  F15 and F16  strike aircraft  etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  simulations based around this conflict   Great to go and bomb Saddams  bio weapons plants in an F117A on my computer  or shoot down some of his  Migs in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  of war is ignored  A building containing people  or an aircraft flown by a  pilot is simply a target. Dead civilians are collateral damage. These  euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  support are necessary for the continued waging of war   One only has to  look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia  and  the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim Croat Serb conflict in  the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  Sarajevo  and in the last few days of  sorry bout spelling  Sebrenitsa   has caused me to rethink where I stand on justifiable war.I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each  and say    Yes this may have been justifible  this may not. These are simply my gut  reactions to each   In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  my reaction   I am not a historian  so excuse any historical blunders  I  am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.1. The Second World War	  Murder of Jews   Hitler had to be stopped.	  Massive civilian casualties on both sides 		  Dresden  Hiroshima Nagasaki	  Probably justifiable.2. Korean war	  Political expansionism by North Korea  basically	  communism vs. capitalism.	  Probably not justifiable.3. Vietnam	  As above  worsened by US involvement.4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.	  Genocide by Khmer Rouge.	  Probably justifiable.5. Iraq  Desert Storm 	  Political expansionism  threat to world oil supply	  Other factors such as genocide.	  Not sure  but probably justifiable6. A future involvement in Bosnia	  Genocide   so called Ethnic Cleansing	  Emotive   much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.	  Probably justifiable7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons   tactical or strategic   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else   e.g. Libya  or Israel.	  My feelings in this are simple	  Nuclear war weapons are abhorrent	  I love the New Zealand governments stand on banning all nuclear	  armed or powered warships from NZ port.	  Never justifiable.These are my own views  I have looked at scripture  and I am confused. I  would appreciate others view  particularly those based on scripture.

 Political Atheists ,Organization  Tektronix  Inc.  Beaverton   OR.Lines  47In article  1993Apr3.212139.14076 blaze.cs.jhu.edu  arromdee jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu  Ken Arromdee  writes  In article  1pj9bs d4j fido.asd.sgi.com  livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com  Jon Livesey  writes   I would say that one innocent person killed is in some sense  as bad as many.   We certainly feel that way when we punish  someone for a single murder.  Now if we reform system X  by reducing the number of deaths  by one  we produce system XX.    Id say we should not go back  to system X  even though by doing so we would re introduce only   a single extra death.  Bob seems to think that one is as bad as many in a sense somewhat stronger than the one you indicate.     Yes  I do.    My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to  kill people.  That is its primary  and I would argue only   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has  almost no utility  especially when you know you will be killing  innocents  is unconscionable.  At the very least  the existence of the prison system and our  transportation system are based on their merits to society  not  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.  Just in case I wasnt clear again   We maintain a capital  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with  no net positive gain.  Why   Were you to pin me in a corner and ask  I would have to respond  that I dont belief the state should have the right to take life  at all.  But I wont open that debate  as it seems others are  tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.

Jewish Settlers Demolish a Mosque in Gaza,Organization  Manchester Computing CentreLines  41In  C5IwxM.G0z news.chalmers.se  d9bertil dtek.chalmers.se  Bertil Jonell  writes  In article  kutluk.734797558 ccl.umist.ac.uk  kutluk ccl.umist.ac.uk  Kutluk Ozguven  writes   Atheists are not  mentioned in the Quran because from a Quranic point of view  and a  minutes reasoning  one can see that there is no such thing.   But there are people who say that they are Atheists. If they arent Atheists  what are they When the Quran uses the word  din  it means way of individual thinking  behaving communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is ofteninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews Mushriqin  Christians  etc. because the  latter are all din. To have adin you need a set of beliefs  assumptions  etc  to forma a socialcode. For example the Marxist have those  such as History  Conflict etc. That they do not put idols  sometimes they did  to representthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the otherMushriq  or roughly polytheists. There cannot be social Atheism  because when there is a community that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society. When they inscribe assumptions  say Nation  or  Progress is the natural consequence of Human activity  or  parlamentariandemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government   however they individually insist they do not have gods  from the Quranic pointof view they do. Therefore by definition  atheism does not exist.  We are a atheist society  in fact means  we reject the din other thanours . Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols gods dogmas suppositions .. of the society that they part  and in that case thatis a personal deviation of belief  and Quran tells about suchdeviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned  from a Quranic point oflooking at things  there is no Atheism in the macro level. I think it took more than one minute.Kutluk

EDT	     	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Good afternoon.  	     	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   That would be nice.  Lets go out to the cherry blossoms.  Well do like the President.	     	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead  	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Absolutely not.  	     	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks   You said it was a good visit  but no compromise.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Yes.  The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before  there were no specific compromises on either side  although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well.  As you know  the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not speak    Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning    when the President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake  and at the close of that conversation  indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked about that yesterday afternoon.	     	     At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night  which they did  when the Senator was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific compromises made on either side  they did say that they would continue to have some discussions.  And thats where we are.	     	     Q	  Well  who is giving in   Where is it standing   are both making concessions 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know that its at that phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said consistently  he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  He believes in the package  but he believes that if its going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it  hes willing to make those adjustments.	     	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Oh  boy.	     	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Sure.	     	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes   	     	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made  but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Sorry  Andrea  Im not going to go down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said this morning  a number of groups  a number of members of Congress  a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at.  The working group is looking at it  but no decisions have been made.	     	     Q	  To follow  have they done that directly through him   Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Not to my knowledge  although theres a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.	     	     Q	  At the meetings that hes had with his own task force advisers  have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think that that has been presented for a decision  no.	     	     Q	  Not for a decision  but has it been discussed as an option 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Again  there are a lot of levels of briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as  okay  this is something for you to decide on.  	     	     Q	  Youre not saying he didnt know it was being considered  though  are you 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No  he said its being considered.	     	     Q	  He knew that.	     	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers   Thats what Im asking.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The President has said its being considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I dont even know that its   	     	     Q	  But he didnt say he was considering  did he  at this stage 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No  he is not.  I think were getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is considered    	     	     Q	  Well  he is the one who said  I havent reviewed it.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   That is true.  That is what I just repeated. 	     	     Q	  George  is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered hed let us know  and having it trickle out the way it did  that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think so.  I mean  it is now public knowledge that this is being considered.	     	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered  and then to have it come out not from you people  but   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Well  wait a second.  It came out from the administration.  What are you talking about 	     	     Q	  What Im saying is  though  that the President said he would let us know. 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Right.	     	     Q	  You people then said    you said  I believe  that its not going to be on the program.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   On March 25th.	     	     Q	  On March 25th. 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Circumstances change.	     	     Q	  Well  I understand.  But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Rooting around    I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is    laughter     the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  I mean  that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration  the headline is    Ill look at it right here  and AP story     Clinton wants more money for spying. 	     	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being considered  hed tell us about it   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   And the administrations concerned  and hed let you know.	     	     Q	  And did he 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say this morning 	     	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   It didnt have to be dragged out of me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB  we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his administration.  That is his administration policy.	     	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons  or were they orchestrated leaks   I mean  what was the   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   They were asked questions  they answered the questions.	     	     Q	  Youre saying here that it didnt have to be dragged out  that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Absolutely.  I was very clear.  Painfully clear.	     	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No  it was just this issue is being considered.  They were asked if it was being considered  they answered that it was being considered.	     	     Q	  George  The New York Times   	     	     Q	  Why do it yesterday 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   They were asked.	     	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last months unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the Presidents job stimulus bill  but which turned out to be totally false.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know if it was totally false  but I think     laughter     the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing  and they say that. 	     	     Q	  The question is  is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data   And whats he doing about it  if so 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The chief economist has said that a mistake was made  it wont happen again  and thats the end of the matter.	     	     Q	  Isnt that the same information that goes to the President 	     	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Theres two separate pieces of information.  I think thats where the confusion was.	     	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I read the article this morning.	     	     Q	  And as far as you know  is the President aware of it 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think so.	     	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know.  Not to my knowledge.	     	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning   Anything 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I didnt.	     	     Q	  Wasnt the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose   For his speeches  for his arguments 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Well again  Im not sure.  Both statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence  essentially  was misleading.  They said it was a mistake.  They said they wouldnt do it again.	     	     Q	  Did they drop it    is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Whenever fewer people are out of work  were gratified.  But that doesnt take away from the need to get this jobs package going.	     	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was    that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday  or did he  in the conversation with Dole  talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think at this point theres no changes in the schedule at all.  I dont know that they discussed the timing like that.	     	     Q	  Do you believe that youre closer or getting closer this week than you were last week 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Again  I believe that were going to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I dont know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I dont know whats going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.	     	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation has changed 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Were going to continue to work on it.  Well know when the votes are taken.	     	     Q	  George  last week you said that there are    or various people in the administration were saying that you couldnt go through Dole  you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise  or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept.  This week youre talking to him.  Is that because youve realized that the peeling off effort wasnt going to work 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Thats because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus package.	     	     Q	  He initiated the conversation 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Yes.	     	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that  in fact  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You say hes making   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know that thats exactly what he said.  I think he said he didnt have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise  and the President doesnt want to compromise.  And the President doesnt want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get it through  he will.	     	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Its possible.	     	     Q	  Today 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Im not sure exactly when that will happen  but I think that its very possible that well come forward with some sort of a different package  or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed.	     	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole  the first one was some discussion of this and Ill get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments  or whatever the phrase is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think its a question of how detailed.  I mean  I think they had a general discussion about the package last night  subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow up discussions today in the Senate  not necessarily between the President and Senator Dole.  And let me just reiterate  neither side has made specific compromises at this date.  When we have something well let you know.  And Im not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that weve talked about or that weve offered anything in a hard way.	     	     Q	  What are the follow up discussions if not the President and Dole 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Dole.	     	     Q	  Is that a threat    Laughter. 	     	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole  all right  how about this number as an overall size  or did Dole say to the President  I can go as high as this   Did they talk numbers 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think it was a negotiation in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.	     	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Im just not sure.  I know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked about the programs they cared about.  I dont know if they got to the level of this many x billion dollars. 	     	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No  of course not.	     	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking   Was that in any way organized by   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Not to my knowledge  no.	     	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think hes talked to them  no.	     	     Q	  George  is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have nots   And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few  with the haves having to pay for the have nots 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans  as he presented in his budget  should go up.  And I think for the second half of your question  Ill refer you to my briefing from yesterday.	     	     Q	  George  on the subject of accuracy in information  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is not true.  Its actually waste water money.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Its waste water money for Wisconsin  and some could go to Milwaukee. 	     	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem because its waste water money  right 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   It would affect the water treatment overall. 	     	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  Would you agree thats not the case 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Im not sure of the specifics.  I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.	     	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning  which was  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Im not sure exactly when.  I just dont know.  I assume it came up over the last    certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  	     	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think thats right.  I dont know the exact date.	     	     Q	  George  the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently  the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax hes proposed  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes hes already proposed   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think weve said all we have to say about the VAT at this point.  I mean  theres just no    this is being considered by the health care working groups  and that is all.  The President hasnt made any further decisions beyond that. 	     	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care  it wouldnt be to replace some other tax that finances    it wouldnt replace the income tax  for instance 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   There have been no discussions on that.	     	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress  Senator Doles press release today said VAT    on tax day.  Do you think    does it have a chance of getting through Congress   Would it have a chance 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I have no idea. 	     	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do it.  Its not in consideration now.	     	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under consideration.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Yes  what the President referred to this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered.	     	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed   Thats the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Thats what he said. 	     	     Q	  Is that true 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Yes.	     	     Q	  Was there  in fact  some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Im not going to get into the deliberations.	     	     Q	  But  George   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No.  What the consideration is  as the President said  groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. 	     	     Q	  Is that the only thing thats changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Yes.	     	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups    how that information got to him that groups wanted it   Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think the groups    as you know  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.	     	     Q	  But this is the Presidents knowledge that these groups had come forward.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups.  Obviously  there have also been published positions in the newspapers.	     	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the groups presentations to them 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know if theyve briefed him    I mean  how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups.	     	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know  its just theyve had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care.	     	     Q	  The President wasnt aware of those longstanding positions 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   He may have been at some level.  Obviously  hes been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.	     	     Q	  What were trying to figure out here    youre telling us that the only change  the only thing that affected this change in the Presidents attitude toward the VAT between February and now   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The Presidents attitude hasnt necessarily changed.  I mean  he has not made a decision.	     	     Q	  I know  but the President said that it was off the table.  So did you.  And youre saying that the only thing thats changed is the positions of these groups  except youre also describing them as longstanding positions.  I dont see the change.  If these groups havent had any change in their position thats been made to the President   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Well  theyve made the presentations to the health care task force.	     	     Q	  Theres no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said    suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue.	     	     Q	  Well  he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   He did say that.  I dont know that he said anything to refute that.	     	     Q	  But  in fact  has the task force discovered that there wouldnt be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Again  I dont think that the task force ever suggested that there would.	     	     Q	  George  if he advocated a VAT tax  would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I cant comment on a hypothetical situation.	     	  	     Q	  But does that promise    would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The President has made no decisions on the VAT tax.  When he does  well tell you and well explain the implications then.	     	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite    business  labor or otherwise    whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont have the specific.  I just dont have that.	     	     Q	  George  can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives  for instance  the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No  as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said  they are looking at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration.  But Im not going to comment   	     	     Q	  Whats the scope   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Im just not going to comment on them  no.	     	     Q	  Whats the scope of the need   How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Thats what the health care task force is looking at.	     	     Q	  Since theres not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit  two questions   One  generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for  but more specifically  is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The Vancouver note 	     	     Q	  Does no mean yes.	     	     Q	  Yes and no.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Well  I dont know.  I saw the Prime Ministers press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S. that we want to do something about.	     	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS    I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly.  I dont necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Ministers comments.	     	     Q	     that we need specific export targets  specific numerical targets    is that what hes going to discuss with Miyazawa 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Theyre going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I dont want to get into those specifics until after the meeting.	     	     Q	  Why 	     	     Q	   Thats the crux of the issue  right   Whether or not    does the President believe that without specific numerical targets  it is really  as he said in his press conference  sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.	     	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think  first  the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself  and then hell make the comment on it.	     	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package   There seems to be some confusion about how the U.S. views that  Secretary Christopher saying    or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more  the Japanese saying that thats not what they heard 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Again  were going to continue to work with all our allies in the G 7  and were going to continue to press for help for Russian reform  Russian democratic reform.  And I think that  so far  we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and were going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages.	     	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Were going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can.	     	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatchers comments on the Bosnia policy.  And he said   Its a rather emotional response.   	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Over an emotional issue.	     	     Q	  Right    to an emotional problem.  Does the White  House condone that kind of remark 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think that Secretary Christophers remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that were trying to find answers for. 	     	     Q	  But that specific     rather emotional response     specific term 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   No  it speaks for itself.	     	     Q	  In connection with that  doesnt it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment  is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   For example 	     	     Q	  To take stronger action  to take military action    air strikes  anything that can be done 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also    as you know  the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time.	     	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Theyre wrong.  Were pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  Were pressing hard for increased sanctions  and were talking to our allies about the arms embargo.	     	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to that.  Now  Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that change your thinking 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Clearly  were going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say.  But at this point  the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo.	     	     Q	  A follow up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are you going to be able to do that  or do you have anything   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think thats what she said.	     	     Q	  Thats exactly what she said.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think thats true.  But what she said    we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously  if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade  that will have an effect over time.  I do not know day by day  minute by minute  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been.   But  clearly  we are slowing the shipment of goods into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I dont know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all  I dont know why theyd be fighting it so much.	     	     Q	  Are the First Ladys tax returns going to be released 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I think theres a joint tax return.  And it will be probably later today.	     	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont think theres any proposal for that at this time  not that I know of.	     	     Q	  Its something that the President promised during the campaign that he would do.	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I have not seen any    I dont think its anything thats on his plate right now.	     	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know about on this issue.  I assume that hell meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon  as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities.	     	     Q	  Do you know if thats scheduled   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   Its probably going to be tomorrow.	     	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow    Laughter. 	     	     Q	  Its a good thing you asked.	     	     Q	  Whos probably going to be there    Laughter. 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know.	     	     Q	  How long   	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know.  Thats all I know.	     	     Q	  Do you know if its at 3 00 p.m. tomorrow    Laughter. 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know what time it is.  I dont even know for sure if its going to be tomorrow.	     	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen  do you know 	     	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS   I dont know if theyve asked  but I think the President has always planned  as he did last year  to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If its not exactly on Earth Day  it might be a day before or something lik"

I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor.      I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip.      Is this true  I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS      slot.  Is that true            Thanks      David Mirsky      mirsky gnu.ai.mit.edu     Well  I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed            One  socket  for an additional VRAM SIMM           One  socket  for a 72 pin RAM SIMM           One socket for a flat pack FPU           A processor direct slot  PDS  identical to the LC LC II  but with         an additional set of connetions to one side  for the full 32 bit         data path that the LC LC II lacked     Thats it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit   in the PDS  but thats the only place.   So  will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade  or will it require a logic board swap  It would be interesting for Apple to come out with a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPUs 680x0  like RocketShare. But I guess thats getting a bit fantastic   I was wondering  since MacWeek reported that developers were seeded with PowerPCs on a NuBus card.  Also  any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed  Last I heard  the estimates were around 3 4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines at a much earlier date that Q1 94  but I doubt its true.  Finally  is the PowerPC developers CD mini course available  I saw it advertised in the developers university calendar  and Id like to know if its at all  interesting .  Sean                seanmcd ac.dal.caRadius speculated  publicly  that they could provide a PowerPC basedRocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare andthe minus of NuBus accelerators   no true boot off the accelerator NuBus bottleneck to video and other I O.Apple  it seems  will not compete with third parties here    exceptperhaps for not yet available Macs like Cyclone  where a PowerPCslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPCaccelerators.One potential problem with any accelerator  though  is that it willneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius  withRocketshare  to use any of its proprietary code.Apple is  between the lines  trying to let us know that PowerPC Macswill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISCand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those inexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps  then  well see groundbreakingprices in Mac logic board upgrades  much the same way weve seenmuch cheaper high performance CPUs this year.First generation PowerPCs  98601s  will also hopefully have socketedCPUs so that theyll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulledfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage  whichI doubt since the external busses are the same size width  to dothis  perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard  a la Powerbook  asstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area whereApple has fallen far behing the Intel based world. Perhaps catchupis in order.By the way  last weeks PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC Pentium  MIPS R4000  DEC Alpha  the big four on the microprocessorfront for the forseeable future . Worth reading for technojunkies.Also  the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it  and allthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminentright now.Once anyone is this secure  they are due to fall. Intels marketposition will never again be as dominant as it is today  especiallyif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears itmight . The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesomebattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC  while notguaranteed dominance  is a guaranteed winner  even if its one ofseveral.Mark

Vanishing font problem    ,Organization  Department of Mathematics  Queens University at KingstonLines  25   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.When he first logs on  via xdm   he has a single xterm window appearwith the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration  X windowsapplications  particularly xdvi  work fine.  However  if he opens up asecond xterm application  suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error  Unable to load ISO 8859 1 font.   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initialone references a different name in the Xsession file  with prettiercolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that onlyopening a default xterm causes this behaviour  and more significant  ALLX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from thecommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a differentfont  using the  fn option   no problems.  It would seem that thedefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to loseall of its fonts.  Note  xlsfonts in either window shows all of thefonts available  so there doesnt appear to be a problem in the fontdirectories hash tables.   Other than rewriting the XTerm app defaults file to use a differentfont and hope for the best  does anyone have any ideas More info   This is the most recent MIPS workstation  R4000 I believe         with the most current operating system and running X11R5.       It is not mwms fault  as the same problems occur under twm  etc.

How does it compare to a Toyota Camry   I thought the car looked very solid  stable and European.  Only disappointment so far is that that it doesnt offer an airbao my next question is  why isnt VW offering automobiles with airbags   Should I pay the extra three thousand for a BMW 318 is even though it is smaller and less powerful than than the Passat I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing.  Its only been in the lastyear or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements forpassive restraint  but didnt guess that the merican consumer wouldactually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out thearticle in last weeks Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs andJettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico  but they dont havethe quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice  the USlaunch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again  until a good chunkof the useful life of the design is spent.I think that Passats come from Germany  so there is not the samequality and availability issue.  Its a nice car with a nice engine.Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two years time is adifferent question...Ill leave the Passat   Camry flamewar for someone else.

Husak   husak ux1.cso.uiuc.edu   Univerisity of IllinoisDoes it do it to all tapes   Were the two tapes that it unwound of the sametype from the same batch   The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapesthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out andhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels If you have not yet  open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom ofthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it  look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My bestguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the secondmarker   Anyhow  If the tape has the holes  then check to see if the mirror on the tapeis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  Thetape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area wherethe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by  the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirtyor out of alighment  unlikely since it is made into the case  you might havea problem detecting the end of the tape.If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good  then eitherthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you openthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R W headassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way  then the drive mayneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensoris out. If it is still in warranty  you might be able to send it back to CMS forrepair.

 Final Solution for Gaza  ,"Organization  Case Western Reserve University  Cleveland  Ohio  USA Lines  227NNTP Posting Host  thor.ins.cwru.edu Center for Policy Research writes...   Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto                                         While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto  they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans.    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting     and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find     your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than    anti Israel bigotry. The Gaza strip  this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world  has been cut off from the world for weeks. The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza  some 700.000 people  by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel.    It is NOT punishment  but protection from repeated attacks by    residents of Gaza.  You self servingly omit any references to    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation  a    racist ommission on your part. While Polish non Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto  no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews  only dozens of people  is humanitarian assistance.  The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors.    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave    of murder does not matter to you  then your posturing for the    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing    but an anti Israel charade. As is known  the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel  although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels  shops and fields.     Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli    citizenship and were denied   I have heard of no such denials    taking place.  Can you document this  or is this more of your    stupid and innacurate propaganda   The truth is that if Gazan    residents applied for citizenship  HAMAS would murder them as    collaborators.	     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel. They may not live there  for these areas are reserved for the Master Race.    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you    attack a people  when you omit facts which fly in the face of    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have       the same bigoted makeup as you           Heres another little fly in your ointment  about the master     race  for you to avoid...    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the    responsibility for them  they were allowed into Israel.  Yes     Israel.  But when the plane landed  the Israeli Arabs who had    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved    with the rescue project  because they felt that it would make    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved    them to a kibbutz  where they are safe and secure.  The truth    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of    the 400 deportees  Lebanon was willing to let their so called    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary    in Lebanon.      Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait  just    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil rich     nations who do nothing for these people  is to use the plight     of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews  or    your hatred of Israel.  Anti semitism and anti Zionism is NOT    the same as pro Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare. The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self  administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators.    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives  or    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take    something like the Warsaw Ghetto the creation of which you do    not even bother to discuss  and the uprising that followed is    to degrade the dead  and to show that intelligent debate on a     difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of     the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single    most anti semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf  yet it    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it    were considered  you might actually have to deal with mideast    problems in a balanced manner  rather than in an anti semitic    manner. As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law  that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self determination  it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings.     And just how was Gaza obtained   Do you forget that Israel is    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it  but had    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start   Did you know land    Israel captures in wars  wars which other nations have ALWAYS    started  arent the same as Israel  and they are subject to a     completely different set of international laws   Since you do    continuously refer to international law  would you please say    what specific international laws Israel is violating       						   This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews.     I can cite 6 000 000 reasons why it is not.                                                              The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that Gaza sink into the sea.     Where is this quote   I have never heard Rabin assert that he    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar  youll    have to provide the entire quote  with source  or this effort    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.                                            One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans   Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve      Only you are led to ask such a loaded  racist  intellectually    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order. I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human  civil and political rights  to which they are entitled as human beings.    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran     or Iraq  or Yemen  or Saudi Arabia  or Syria   Do you have an    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades   Or     what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait   Or what    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims   Do you think the    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims     in Bosnia are enduring   Why are you indifferent to the death    and suffering of people   Why do you not care that these folk    are being exterminated   Why do you not care that only Israel    has given any of these people safe haven   Could it be due to     the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing   The    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They arent being    killed.  They arent being raped.  They arent being starved.    They arent being driven from their lands.  They are not kept    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your     life to attacking  in the guise of compassion.        Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your    case  it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence   Maybe these    fits of anti semitism are a result of being cut off from your     own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be      it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to     appear to be.  When you realize that you cant care for other     people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do     some good.     But for now  you are a fruad. "
food related seizures ,Organization  S.P. Dyer Computer Consulting  Cambridge MALines  18In article  79727 cup.portal.com  mmm cup.portal.com  Mark Robert Thorson  writes  I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring from the diet.  The theory    which was backed up by interesting anecdotal results    is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these chemicals than other people.  I dont remember any connection being made with seizures  but it certainly couldnt hurt to try an all natural diet.Yeah  the  Feingold Diet  is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADDwho are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual andsocial skills  which in fact continue to decline.  Of course  the parentswho are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of theirchildrens development.  So much for the value of  interesting anecdotalresults .

So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us     1. Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous      ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous  including   the millions of Americans of Arab ancestry.  Perhaps you can answer   the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members   in California  and elsewhere      Friendly rivalry perhaps     Come on   Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war   against Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is  the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals  only a few years ago.      The ADC is an organization of Arab  AMERICANS .  Let me see...youre saying that  most if not all  Arab AMERICANS should be spied on   Youre also saying that  most if not all  Arab AMERICANS should be views as a national security threat to Israel  and the US   as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing  in  which no Arab AMERICANS were involved    By inference  can we assume  that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses  a threat to Israel and  therefore  should be spied on Like it or not  Edward  Anwar has a very good  valid point.  Obviously in presenting it  he  quite legitimately and deliberately  takes a pointof view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended  butthat is one of the best ways to demonstrate a  slippery slope  type ofargument  which I believe was his aim.I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in thiscase.  I doubt theres enough evidence to weigh against them even in acivil court  where preponderance of the evidence  not evidence beyondany reasonable doubt  is the standard for  winning  such a case.

Why is my mouse so JUMPY   MS MOUSE ,Nntp Posting Host  pelham.med.unc.eduOrganization  UNC CH School of MedicineLines  33In article  1993Apr23.140123.5018 cti.com  rlister cti.com  Russell Lister  writes  ecktons ucs.byu.edu  Sean Eckton  writes    I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00  was using 8.20   I think  but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better .  Vertical motion   is nice and smooth  but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes cant click   on something because my mouse jumps around.  I can be moving the mouse to   the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly   for a bit  then jump to the right  then move smoothly for a bit then jump   again  maybe this time to the left about .5 inch  .  This is crazy   I have   never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  Anyone have any solutions      Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be     just venting steam     I had the same problem.  At first  I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers  because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didnt help and after a bit of   experimentation  determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse  I borrowed   a new mouse  a MS bus model  and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So  if your mouse is old  you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.   Another alternative is to clean the mouse youve got.  Sometimes therollers inside the mouse pick up a ball of lint or other debris.  Open thebottom of the mouse  take out the ball and use some alcohol on a Q tip toclean it out.  Inspect the inside for any hairs or fuzz.  I have had mymouse get real jumpy and cleared up the problem with this procedure.

Doesnt it seem like we are spending all of our lives    trying to reach a goal we can never achieve   I know that we are saved by    faith and not by works  but does that mean that once we are saved we dont    have to do anything   I think James tells us that Faith without works is    dead  paraphrase .  How does this work    So long as we think that good things are what we  have  to do rather than what we come to  want  to do  we miss the point. The more we love God  the more we come to love what and whom He loves.  When I find that what I am doing is not good  it is not a sign to try even harder  Romans 7 14 8 2   it is a sign to seek God. When I am aware  of Jesus presence  I usually want what He wants. It is His strenth  His love  that empowers my weakness.     Stan Armstrong. Religious Studies Dept  Saint Marys University  Halifax  N.S. Armstrong husky1.stmarys.ca   att clyde watmath water dalcs armstrngI apologize to the moderator  but the first quote was deleted and Iwould like to respond to both.As for the  goal we can never achieve   the reward comes from thetrying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining forthe prize over in Philippians 3 10 16.  Only by not living out thecommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm  to be spit out by Jesus.As it says in 1 John 5 3    This is love for God   to obey his comands. That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course  thisrequires work on our part.As for the quote in James  Satan doesnt care what we believe.  Whatmatters is the results of our belief  works .  If one truly has faith inwhat one believes  one will either act on that faith or be lying tooneself about believing in the first place.  Stan  as for your first line  you have a very good point.  Obedience byobligation  grudgery  is not what God desires.  Instead  look at howmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and whendoing Gods work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also  weshould do the work necessary whenever we can  not just when we feelJesus presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However  as Paul states toTimothy in 2 Timothy 4 2    Preach the Word  be prepared in season andout of season  correct  rebuke and encourage  with great patience andcareful instruction.   Also  remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1Timothy 4 16    Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere inthem  because if you do  you will save both yourself and your hearers. So  in order to do the work necessary  we need to be sure that we arecorrect first.  Remember Jesus warning in Matthew 7 3 5 not to behypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to bea disciple completely in both thought and deed.  Joe Fisher "
Is ms windows a  mature  OS ,From  JesseOriginator  cyen ponder.csci.unt.eduKeywords  ms windowsOrganization  Computer Science Dept. of UNTDistribution  usaLines  39hi   Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x  If the answer is positive  you wouldknow if ms windows is a  mature  OS.  Days ago people doubted that ms windows is not a real OS. I can see whythey have such question. Ms windows confuses many people. Microsoftsimulated Mac  but it did a lousy job.  For example  1  You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group    in a group.  If you know how  please tell me.  2  Too many system parameters to take care of.  3  uncomplete documentation. Its not easy to find the reason why causes    an unpredictable error. 4  Group deleting file deleting    After deleting a group  users have to use file manager to delete files.    But if users forget to delete some related files  the disk will be full    of nonsense files. 5  share problem    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some    language  w o good editor   there will be a sharing problem. You just    can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to    prevent from saving  but not opening.Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows  but they just make ms windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purposeof ms windows should be to simplify the environment  and make PC easier to use.    Its by no means easy to satisfy everybody  but if Microsoft want tokeep their reputations  they should evaluate the user interface morecarefully before products distribute.

Were from the govt    ,Summary   Loss leader  argument does not washOrganization  Not Aging  Just Improving  Inc.Lines  76Nntp Posting Host  thor.isc br.comIn article  SLAGLE.93Apr5075759 sgi417.msd.lmsc.lockheed.com  slagle lmsc.lockheed.com writes  In article  1993Apr2.185755.17803 isc br.isc br.com   steveh thor.isc br.com  Steve Hendricks  writes     Thanks to Kim for following up.  I was hoping that someone would bring up   the issue of cost compensation.  The problem with the argument is that it   fails to explain why kidney dialysis  RD  services have expanded massively in   the last decade.  After all  no one is forcing private providers to offer   this service.  If they are losing money on the treatment  which according    to information Ive collected from several providers they are not  why   would they not simply limit their losses by cutting back on services    engage in effective rationing of supply  rather than expand the coverage   to a larger market that must then be compensated by raising prices in   other areas   Perhaps there is a competitive advantage in there after all.  Would not reputable and dedicated physicians prefer to affiliate with an institution that offers dialysis services   Would they not therefore tend to admit patients in greater numbers to an institution that  offered a full range of diagnostic and treatment options   Undoubtedly.  In fact  it is the fact that hospitals frequently competefor physicians rather than for patients that  in part  complicates and undermines a simplistic free market analysis of the market for medical care. Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high tech  high price  machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.Once again  there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidneydialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of servicesto a much greater volume of patients  RD is still a profitable service.Otherwise  one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than thevast expansion that has occurred.    Remember  the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but   make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market.      Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an array of products at prices below cost   Are not grocery stores embedded in a relatively free market Can you spell  loss leader    I knew you could.  Grocery stores do notattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more ofit.  In fact  your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather  it appears thatprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion ofservice and development of improved lower cost technology to provide comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD  they simplymake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsdaypredictions of free market advocates would have been seen    restrictionof service  lagging technological development  etc.  Likewise  it appearsthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems  where providers are government agencies  some of these negative impacts may occur.   RD patients in the VA system in Spokane  for example  must travel toSeattle  300 miles away  for treatment.   The bottom line  however  is that this is an example of government intervention  of a rather extreme sort  that appears to have had beneficialresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that  governmentbureaucracy  inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplaceshould take such such cases into account.jsh   Mark  Steve Hendricks                           DOMAIN   steveh thor.ISC BR.COM    One thing about data  it sure does cut   UUCP     ... uunet isc br thor steveh the bulls  t.

MORBUS MENIERE   is there a real remedy ,Organization  Netcom Online Communications Services  408 241 9760 login  guest Lines  87In article  19392 pitt.UUCP  geb cs.pitt.edu  Gordon Banks  writes  In article  lindaeC4JGLK.FxM netcom.com  lindae netcom.com writes      My biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like most  people with dizziness can be cured.  Thats definitely not the  case.  In most cases  like I said above  it is a long  tedious  process that may or may not end up in a partial cure.      Be sure to say  chronic  dizziness  not just dizziness.  Most patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better. The vertiginous spells of Menieres will also eventually go away  however  the patient is left with a deaf ear.All true.  And all good points.   To anyone suffering with vertigo  dizziness  or any variation  thereof  my best advice to you  as a fellow sufferer  is this...  just keep searching...dont let the doctors tell you theres  nothing that can be done...do your own research...and let your  This may have helped you  but Im not sure it is good general advice.  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim.  When good answers to these then  spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive things in life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself that your doctor gave you the correct story  but after it becomes clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine has no good solution  perhaps the best strategy is to join the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to make a career out of it.Well  making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believethat doing your own research is very  very necessary.  I wouldnot have progressed as much as I have today  unless I had spentthe many hours in Stanfords Med Library as I have done.And 5 years ago  it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thankgoodness I didnt.  Now I found that there is indeed medicinethat helps me.  I think that what youve said is kind of idealistic.  That youwould go to one doctor  get a diagnosis  maybe get a secondopinion  and then move on with your life.Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country  I have received 6 different diagnoses.These are the top names  the ones that people come to from all overthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Goingto a support group  and in fact  HEADING that support group  was helpful for a while  but after a point  I found it veryunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.A recent movie  Lorenzos Oil  offers a perfect example of whatIm talking about.  If you havent seen it  you should.  Its nota put down of doctors and neither is what Im saying.  Doctors areonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of usout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missingpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.I guess Im biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingsthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm  or a weak heart or failing kidneys  I might not have the same opinion.  Thats because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments.  With dizziness  you just have todecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tofind your way out of it.I have chosen the latter.Lindalindae netcom.netcom.com                                                                                   Gordon Banks  N3JXP         Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect  and geb cadre.dsl.pitt.edu      it is shameful to surrender it too soon.                                                                               
what are the problems with nutrasweet  aspartame ,Organization  S.P. Dyer Computer Consulting  Cambridge MALines  30In article  1993Apr17.181013.3743 uvm.edu  hbloom moose.uvm.edu   Heather   writes  Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces  when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate  substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage  as both are toxic to living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide  so a product of itshydrolysis is going to be methanol  which can then be oxidized toformaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion ofaspartame containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise since youre forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othercomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administrationof high doses of the additive  blood methanol levels were undetectable.Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydeand formic acid  two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelscan damage tissues like the retina and kidney  because at such high dosesthe bodys detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly  onetreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk onethyl alcohol  vodka or an equivalent.  Thats because ethanol ismetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.If the methanol stays as methanol and isnt metabolized to formaldehyde it is actually relatively non toxic.

Homosexuality ,Lines  114Return Path   amail.amdahl.com rich.bellacera juts.ccc.amdahl.com Tony I read your post  it was nothing new  I had seen much the same in othertypical Christian  anti gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and willcon  tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You maybe unaware of all the statistica  findings  concerning African Americans thathave been published and used by various groups to re enforce their own biasagainst African Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances but there are many other groups.  Of course  the vast majority of the publicscoff at such findings and documents today  but that was not always the case.Fortunately African Americans had  whites  who supported their cause andpublic sentiment was eventually  if not entirely  turned around.  There waseven a Civil War  and anti negro sentiment increased.  In fact  until lawswere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was prettymuch legal to discriminate against them.I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be freeform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something that is your perogative.  My church  Christian Church  Disciples of Christ openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creationand making disciples.  We believe in the Lords great commandment to Love and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed  even if it is not popularto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find achurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believesin the commandment of Love  though Im hard pressed to find many who actuallysho Love   but not many are willing to champion the oppressed  especiallywithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christiancommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs  but so did the abolitionistsagainst the oppression of African Americans.  Many were even killed andtreated as runaway slaves for being  nigger lovers  and such.  I guess Ivedecided the challenge is worth it.In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragicstory centering around failed marriages  wives and husbands who are straightwho have been hurt in the process  etc.  Funny thing is  I dont know of onecase where the parents  ex wives  or even children have continued to rejecttheir gay family member  son  daughter  ex husband  father  etc.  after theybegan to take part in some form of support group  like PFLAG.Im apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado  and am equally out0raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon  from the Tradition ValuesCoalition  have been actively working in the Christian underground to garnersupport within several  8 I believe  states this coming November for moreoppressive legisation against gays.Perhaps you dont get it  and maybe you never will.  Many didnt get it in theMiddle Ages and the proclaimed Gods will be done as they massacred thousandsin witch hunts and inquisitions.The message that comes through  loud and clear  by proponents against gayrights and against gays in general  is that there is a strong dislike  evenhatred for gays  whether you want to call it such or not  it doesnt changethe results .  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end  thefinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a conditional  love for gays.  Condition   Change and well love you. This issure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an  unconditional love  one that calls people  just as they are.   Sure there are things thatwill naturally change  and habits  like alcoholism  wife beating  etc.  thatneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are thingslike left handedness  etc. that no amount of beating it out of people  isgoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to  otherpeoples expectations.  In the process this coerced conformity causes manypeople a great deal of harm  especially when it is caused by people who havenothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about theirown sense of pseuper spirituality.This is sad  but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may beunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do withsomething very personal like sexuality  a taboo subject even today   but Ifirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulationon thier bedrooms.  Its funny that most straight people have successfullyremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though ithelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.Gay people are not criminals.Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismaticchurch in the Silicon Valley  here  had two of its pastors arrested for self admitted charges of pederasty  men having sex with boys .  This had apparentlybeen going on for some time  a couple years    but since the charges werevoluntary  and the church worked closely with the police  so I imagine thatwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thinghappen when the church  itself  has an ex gay ministry   One of my friendsrecently told me he was  approached  by someone who is going through thereparitive therapy there  and he was thoroughly convinced that the request fordinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.These are difficult times we live in  but providing hostile environments andcreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is notthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment inColorado has created an organization whos posters are appearing all overColorado called  S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.   I forget the whole definition off hand but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash  and their mottois  Working for a fag free America  with an implicit advocation for violence.This is sick  and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson  and others areembracing.We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppressiontowards those we feel dont measure up  and constant beratement fromorganizations like The Christian Research Institute  while they do have a goodpurpose also  their major work seems to be finding new and better ways ofexcluding people.The Gospel I believe is not so negative  rather it seeks ways to  include people.  I have several of Dr. Martins books and find them quite helpful especially concerning cults. But it seems that CRI  has become a cult untoitself.  Why dont we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring peopleto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away WhateverRich

Elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in theirhigh school by a Palestinian  freedom fighter  be the ones who offertheir help to the Gazans. Perhaps it should be the families of the 18Israelis who were murdered last month by Palestinian  freedomfighters .The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves andtheir families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers. Groups like Hamasand the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving allJews into the sea. Perhaps  we should persuade Jewish people to helpthese wnderful  freedom fighters  attain this ultimate goal.Maybe the  freedom fighters  will choose to spare the co operative Jews.Is that what you are counting on  Elias   the pity of murderers.You say your mother was Jewish.

Ido not believe that RSA would consent to such.  However  there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in whichNSA has an interest.

Junk   Theyve made the C D lists for years due to their excellent handling and    acceleration.  They have been around since about  oh  85 or 86  so theyre not    the newest on the lot  and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class    leader.  You can get into a 3.0 L v 6  141 hp  Shadow for  10 11K  the I 4    turbo a bit more   and a droptop for  14 15K.      As an ex Fleet Mgr. of 3000 cars  they were amoung the most trouble free of all models.  I bought one for my wife.  nnnnnnnng  Thank you for playing  I cannot agree with this.  I believedthis and to put it nicely  it was a piece of junk I loved this car  I babied it  I pampered it  and after 2 years  it justcouldnt stay together  I would say that not everyone will have theproblems that I had  but know this  its not just the car  it is theability to get the car fixed  which will NOT happen at anychrysler dodge take your pick dealer.  I dont care if there are going toreform their dealers service with the intro of the LH cars  I will believeit when I see it.  Case and point  the local dodge dealer.  You drive up just looking  you dont even get out of your door  when about 10  yes 10 salesman all eye you like their next meal  and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal  on everything your eye wanders towards.Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem  butthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent  and about 2000 dollars ofwork parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had  and I took careof this car  I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years  but tookit to every checkup it needed  and many that shouldnt have been.1988 Dodge Shadow ESThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.Engine 4 AlternatorsRear Suspension Torsion Bar2 Water pumps5 thermostatsHall effect sensorMain computer4 BatteriesThese were rebuilt repairedRadiatorAutomatic TransmissionPower SteeringThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  Forabout a year before I sold the car  I said to myself  its a good car  Ijust cant find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end  before Itraded it in for a Saturn  the power steering started acting up again.  Ijust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least  5000  7000worth of repairs over its lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can biteme.  Bullshit  whoever backs em best  is just afraid the stupid things aregoing to fall apart  and no one will buy them without assurance  why thehell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.You can do better  and I know people will disagree with me here  butJapanese  like Honda  or Toyota  or the only american car company that Ifeel is a quality product  Saturn.  I will not touch another chryslerproduct again  no way.  I dont care how good the LH cars look good  and Iwill admit they look promising  but not with the support that you get.  GMisnt much better  thank god  they dont control Saturn  like they dotheir divisions  or it would be just another marketing ploy.  Dont get me wrong  i will be watching my car  which I do like  like ahawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it  or any  caris really good  until it has proved itself to me.But since someone else pointed out C D as a source.  I will note  becauseI used to read these magazines  that Car and Driver has never had a goodthing to say about most Chrysler products  Shadow for one   always werethey moaning about the reguritated K car  and engine.  Whereas Motor Trendalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.And although there are alot of people who dont like Consumers Reports  Iwill use them to reinforce my argument  I already know about the big stinkwith the Saturn crash tests  time will tell how good a car they are   theshadow sundance rate much worse than average  in fact none of thechryslers rate a better than average  I think the best one is justaverage.  Excluding the diamond star mitsubishi stuff and the LHs.  Youcan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might  when I researchedthe Saturn  I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great dealof information about this company  just because it is a new americancompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community  forgood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines ofany established company.  I read an article  which had a sub column  an Ithink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig inToyota said and I quote   We are watching them very closely.   Come on everybody grow up  the foreign cars  especially the japanese have beenkicking our butts  for good reason  the american car companies could not makea good product or support the customer the way they want these days  toset in their ways  which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  Theyare still struggling because they havent learned yet.  They have theability  the workers are not inferior  the technology is not out of date but their attitude is  and they are just finding this out.

Is there a biological reason why women cant put  their keys in their pants pockets like men do   I have two pockets on the  back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another.  Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.  Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why cant women do the same   Is is biological  ie  not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and  a wallet  or is it the way they are raised by the parents  Oh PULLEEZE Its not biology at all  its clothing design.  Womens clothing isgenerally designed to be as non functional as possible.  Its only beenin the last five years or so that you could buy womens pants withpockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously  deep pockets werevirtually unknown in womens clothing.  Skirts generally have betterpockets now  too.  Dresses  espcially fancy dresses  are still prettyhopeless.  I often hand my drivers license over to my husband if weredressed up to go out somewhere  so I dont have to be encumbered by apurse.If women consistently bought functional clothing  and boycotted themanufacturers who refuse to make functional womens clothing  I thinkmanufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.

Mat 28 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations  baptizing     them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit        Mat 28 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

Clipper Chip and crypto key escrow ,Keywords  encryption  wiretap  clipper  key escrow  MykotronxReply To  bontchev fbihh.informatik.uni hamburg.deOrganization  Virus Test Center  University of HamburgLines  157strnlght netcom.com  David Sternlight  writes   Though some may argue about the nose of the camel  its worth noting that  the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only  used for that purpose  and does not extend to electronic mail or fileAs usual  David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. Theproposal clearly states    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to   accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure   telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again  David.Maybe youll understand it the next time... Nah  probably not.  encryption  then it IS an improvement over the current mass produced  standard civilian technology which  with a few exceptions  is limited to  easy to break inverters.Thats exactly what the government wants all sheep minded people tothink. Lets look at the current situation. It allows to almostanybody to eavesdrop almost everybody  unless secure  and I meansecure  encryption is used. What will happen when   if   Ha optimists...  the new proposal gets accepted  Almost nobody EXCEPTSOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else  but the ability ofthese  some  to eavesdrop will be guaranteed  The proposal emphasizeson the former   almost nobody     which is clearly an improvement  and  forgets  to mention the drawbacks of the latter   guaranteed  .Yes  my statement assumes that the next step will be to make thestrong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen  Good luck.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.Its not just  continued ability . Its  guaranteed  ability.  Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for  e mail and files  lets focus on this.Yeah  thats exactly what your government wants you to think. Letstake small steps  one at a time. Concentrate on the current one  dontthink about the future. Trust us.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is  limited to telephony  or if the government intends to expand it.Its not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is theintention. They  unlike you  read what they write.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some  I find the proposal  less threatening than many others  since right now most Americans have no  secure telephony  and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a  goat  can  eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and  cordless phones.Yes  it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It willallow only to the government to eavesdrop.  If the scheme is secure of course  which is yet to be proven.  But how do you know that thejerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow  Thenew proposal  guarantees  him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell that will even motivate him to get that job   if he indeed is thatmentally pervert...  Reading between the lines  I infer that the system is highly secure  without access to the keys.Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight  tm has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of anydetails whatsoever and has concluded that it is  highly secure . Iguess  that comes from the background of working some 50 years for thetwo major crypto evaluating companies  right  Gee  now the governmentcan save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of cryptoexperts to secretly analyse the new secret method   for DavidSternlight has already done all the job for them...  This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses  confronted by rich and powerful adversaries  including French and Japanese  security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make  available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs. Trust us  were from the Government and were here to help you.   Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA  and would be delighted to  have a high security system certified by them  even at the price of  depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises offuture safety  do not deserve either.  This  or something like that  Idont have the exact quote  but the meaning is the same  has been saidby one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works morecarefully  if you have the brains to understand them  of course.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that  need to be addressed  including the reliability of the escrows. But inThe main question is to guarantee to availability of  really  securecryptography to the masses. Gee  if the proposal was saying  weguarantee that every American will still have the full right to useany kind of encryption s he would like and regard this proposal asjust a default  voluntary implementation   there would have been muchless opposition... For some reason  they didnt even try to promiseyou that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years   return we get access to high security crypto.No  in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.  Many have suggested that DES  and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly  skilled and endowed.While the above is just rumors  and while even if it is true  it isnot done  easily   the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easilybreakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakableby somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or whohas only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure  why dontyou simply trust them  huh   There is at least a good possibility  which should be  checked  that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesnt have toIt is  guaranteed  to be  easily  breakable   just get the keys. Itmight be even easier  but until there is some evidence  this is just awild speculation.  be  nor does it have to have trapdoors  if the government can get the keysThe trapdoors  are  there. In governments hands. The keys.  pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate  communications against economic adversaries  while still being able to  eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.Legitimate  And who decides what communications are legitimate  Oh  Iguess  its the government  right  The guys who already have the keys Its kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decidewho has the right to use it  legitimately ...  In discussing this  lets try to avoid the nastiness  personal attacks and  noise of some previous threads.Impossible  since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetenceand ignorance as in the provious threads.  This is a substantive and technical issue   and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.Unfortunately  I have yet to see you posting a technically competentmessage.Regards Vesselin   Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev          Virus Test Center  University of HamburgTel.  49 40 54715 224  Fax   49 40 54715 226      Fachbereich Informatik   AGN  PGP 2.2 public key available on request.

Is MSG sensitivity superstition ,Organization  U.C. Berkeley    ERLLines  17NNTP Posting Host  zion.berkeley.eduBetty Harvey writes   I am not a researcher or a medical person but it amazes me that   when they cant find a scientific or a known fact they automatically   assume that the reaction is psychological.  It is mind boggling.This  simply stated  is a result of the bankrupt ethics inthe healthcare and scientific medicine industries.America is fed up with the massive waste and fraud that is costingus 15  of our GNP to support these industries  while delivering marginal health care to the community.Unfortunately  the  Clinton Plan   in whatever form ittakes  will probably cost us an even greater sum.

Returning one     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies. Q4   If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace     all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current     Win 3.1 files Q5   If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out  will I have     any troubles with the W4WG machines When I started this message  I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carriedaway.

Traditionally  they have used pictures  words  demonstrations     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However  expressing    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far    exceed their technical skills.    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia  multimedia and    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar    representions  a confounded user asks   What does it all mean      Since image construction  transmission  reception  decipherment and    ultimate understanding are complex tasks  strongly influenced by    physiology  education and culture  and  since electronic media    radically amplify each processing step  then we  as electronic    communicators  must determine the fundamental paradigms for    composing imagery for understanding.    Therefore  the purpose of this conference is to bring together a    breadth of disciplines  including  but not limited to  the    physical  biological and computational sciences  technology  art     psychology  philosophy  and education  in order to define and    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the    computer graphics context.

SECRET PURPOSE OF FALKLANDS WAR,Organization  University of Wisconsin Eau ClaireLines  918SECRET PURPOSE OF FALKLANDS WAR    with IN VISIBILITY Technology Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER  74 of 80Digitized by Jon Volkoff  mail address eidetics cerf.net AUDIO LETTER R   is a registered trademark of Audio Books Inc.  a Texas corporation  which originally produced this taperecording.  Reproduced under open license granted by AudioBooks  Inc.                                                                 This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER R   1629 K St. NW  Washington DC  20006.   Hello  my friends  this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30 1982  and this is my AUDIO LETTER R  No. 74.  Its now been almost one month since war broke out in the SouthAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that its only a disputebetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren  wind sweptFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality  its farmore than that.   The so called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of agiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982 fierce naval battles have taken place  not only in the SouthAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of thehostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship onall sides.  But as I say these words  the naval war in theSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.   Beginning today  April 30  a total naval and air blockade ofthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time acounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.   To be effective  a blockade must be imposed over a period oftime  but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter iscoming on in the South Atlantic  and the British supply lines areoverextended.  Having come this far  Her Majestys navy cannotsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks timewithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the Britishwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon nomatter how risky they may be.   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has nochoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  Thatreason  my friends  is that the Royal Navy has already sufferedlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there willbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained bythe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting eruptswill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battlelosses.  To obtain that cover story  the British have no choicebut to sail into combat  but in doing so  they will be riskingeven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short my friends  Her Majestys navy has sailed into a trap.   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now weve been hearingcountless commentators referring to the British task force as an armada   quote .  The British of all people ought to be veryuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that itchanged the course of history  and it was none other than theEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during thereign of Englands Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasionfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drakeand his small  fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armadaby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equippedwith new longer range guns  and it stayed upwind and out ofreach.  From there the English pounded  smashed  and shatteredthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over  barelyhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drakesdefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It openedthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start itsexpansion into a truly global empire.   Today  400 years later  history seems to have come fullcircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of theworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I  and nowthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again inconfrontation.  Once again a so called armada is preparing forinvasion  but this time the armada is British  not Spanish.  Fourhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day today  the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the DrakePassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat ofthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spainsnaval supremacy  and now the defeat of the new British armada maywell break the back of what remains of the once glorious RoyalNavy.   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are Topic  1  THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLANDTopic  2  THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERETopic  3  THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.Topic  1  When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this monthit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century anda half since 1833  the Islands have been controlled by GreatBritain.  During that entire time  British sovereignty over theFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have beencountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands  which itcalls the Malvinas  but the threats have always come to nothingin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried aboutthem.   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cubais from the United States  and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy  the Falklands are home to fewerthan 2 000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short  theremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We arewatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten allabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATOsdoorstep.  Instead  Britain is throwing almost everything itsgot at Argentina   aircraft carriers  cruisers  destroyers submarines  assault ships  you name it.  Luxury cruise ships haveeven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activatedand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships andsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty andsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40 ship force hasgrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armadanumbering over 70.  Over two thirds of the entire Royal Navy hasalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.   Watching all this  a lot of people are asking  Whats thisfight really all about   The most popular answer suggested in themajor media is  oil.   Vast deposits of oil are known to existunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does itexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentinathis month  and oil explains even less about the Argentineseizure of South Georgia Island.   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands withno known oil deposits anywhere near it  and compared to SouthGeorgia  the Falklands are an island paradise.  South GeorgiaIsland is covered with rugged mountains  treacherous valleys glaciers  and semi permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that  Argentina has absolutely no legal orhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect itstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while byArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and tookover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina not Britain.   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  Ithas always been controlled by Britain  never by Argentina orSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks evenmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentinasleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  Theywere well aware ahead of time that far off South Georgia Islandcould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they weresetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat  as the Islandwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is  Why did Argentinasmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South GeorgiaIsland at all    My friends  the answers to all these questions are military not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses anenormous military secret.  Its a giant underground installationburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so called Falkland crisis is this secretinstallation  together with two other similar installations whichI will describe shortly.   The secret military complexes have been in existence for manyyears  they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclearwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here inWashington.  For the past two months Ive been reporting thedetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtainand verify them.   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September ofthis year 1982    It is this fast approaching nuclear war threatthat caused the so called Falklands crisis to erupt now.   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part ofthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  Themutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here  namely  theRockefeller cartel  and Russias new rulers in the Kremlin arebehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase  3 ofthe  PROJECT Z  war plan which I revealed last month.  That phaseis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after bothRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WARONE.  As I mentioned last month  the key to this plan is theexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places aroundthe world.   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America areworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions ofother countries to set off war.  Having done that  they intend toride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused  safe and cozy inGovernment war bunkers   When the warring nations finally liesmoldering and exhausted  the Bolsheviks will leave the shatteredremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at thesecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into theopen.  They will confront the world with the only remainingfresh  up to date  powerful military force on earth  and usingthat military power  they will become the undisputed rulers ofthe world  that is  they plan to do all this  and they plan topave the way for world domination very soon by setting offNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller carteland Russias new anti Bolshevik rulers are working together in arace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here arebenefitting from war preparations which were started by theRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years sincethe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the UnitedStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the UnitedStates Government has been a house divided  torn by internalpower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that  the United States had been dominated for decadesboth economically and politically by the Four RockefellerBrothers.   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long range plan for worlddomination.  It was a two prong strategy  half visible and halfsecret  which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secretwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all thedetails  the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  Bydeliberately appearing weak  the Rockefeller controlled UnitedStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons  including superweapons  would beunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961  theRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by thelate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early thatthe war being planned would have very different effects on theNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers  the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union  are located well up in the NorthernHemisphere  so are the other full fledged nuclear powers  GreatBritain  France  Red China  and India.  By contrast  thestrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere arerelatively few and far between.  In other words  it was expectedthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a NorthernHemisphere war.   In an all out nuclear holocaust it is known that seriousradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areasnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far thewar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there isvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and SouthernHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet  cold air fromthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator  thenit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror imageof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone but very little of the air changes places.   The military conclusion  my friends  is this  the comingnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere forgenerations to come  but if the calculations are right  theSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  Aquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefellercartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As Idiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER  NelsonRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America duringthe war.  He accomplished this as so called  Coordinator ofHemispheric Defense  for then President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and itsnatural resources.   Then there is the African continent.  There  too  Rockefellercontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to theefforts of John D. Rockefeller III  as I detailed in AUDIO LETTERNo. 36.   Looking around the globe  the most important remaining landmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia andNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II  both were wide open to theRockefellers.   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret militaryinstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the comingwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of thesurviving southern half of planet Earth after the NorthernHemisphere war.  Then  as the Northern Hemisphere graduallyrecovered from the nuclear holocaust  the Rockefeller empirewould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the thirdgeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty toinherit the Earth.   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily afterthe war  some means would have to be available to projectmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example  revolts againstRockefeller domination would require troops  not a blast from thebeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwarmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  Aminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required  one basedin the South Atlantic  the other in the South Pacific.  Since thereserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after theNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war  they could not be built inexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be builtand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is nosmall task  they take up a lot of space.  On top of that  it wasessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard andnaval base into one over all secret installation.  Finally  thesecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclearattack  otherwise if its existence were ever discoveredprematurely  the secret navy might be wiped out.   The combined requirements for secrecy  space  and protectionagainst attack were formidable  but one day in 1959  while allthese plans were still in the early stages of development  theanswer presented itself.  During a so called banking trip toSweden  David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hiddennaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffswhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port isa gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed offwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the watera huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decidedthat a bigger  more secret  better protected version of theSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey ofcandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey coveredcoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areaswere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to theequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were toomany people living nearby  making the desired level of secrecyimpossible.  Finally  it was essential that the sites chosen forthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.   At last the sites for the secret naval installations wereselected.  In the South Pacific  extreme southern New Zealand wasselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71three months ago when I called attention to New Zealands extremeimportance in the coming war.   In order to obtain the necessary space  the secret New Zealandnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites locatedclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of SouthIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comesdown virtually to the waters edge.  The other part of theinstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Islandfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever sinceWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied evencloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The locationis far from the equator  and the installations are buried deepunder mountains  protected from nuclear attack.  They are alsotoo deep to be reached by particle beam attacks  and the NewZealand site is well situated to command the entire SouthPacific.   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site  my friends  is South Georgia Island.  It is locatedperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  Thetall  rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secretinstallation at the northwest tip of the 100 mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government  like that ofNew Zealand  was willing to cooperate  and South Georgia Islandwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on thenortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away fromthe secret new installation which was being built  but Britaintook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South GeorgiaIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.   Construction of the secret naval facilities  two in NewZealand  one on South Georgia Island  began in the early 1960s. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to buildother large underground facilities  such as the NORADinstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain  Colorado  however thesetechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieveconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way  the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed inappearance both during and after construction.   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to letships in and out were kept as small as possible and were wellcamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement  theentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  Whensealed  the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless youknow exactly where it is  and unlike most large constructionprojects  there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lyingaround to attract attention.  The man made caverns which housethe secret naval installations are enormous  but all the rock anddebris was disposed of at sea.   Once the secret naval facilities were built  they had to beoutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fakedisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributedgreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotalrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then Secretaryof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60s McNamarapresided over the public paring back of Americas visiblemilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantlingof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all thatshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went  my friends was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted inNew Zealand and South Georgia Island    The secret naval installations have been used as duplicationfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed andbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger told Congress recently  it is cheaper to build twoships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship isan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more truein recent years through the use of computerized manufacturingtechniques.   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secretinstallations are made up of duplicates  exact duplicates ofcertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclearpowered  nuclear  subs   nuclear cruisers  nuclear destroyers and yes  nuclear aircraft carriers  three of them.  A secret twinwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz  for the U.S.S. Eisenhower  andfor the newly launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have beenfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns  so called  that weconstantly hear about in the Defense Department  and all threecarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraftwhose manufacture was financed the same way    The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets areall duplicates of other nuclear powered vessels.  Even so  thesecret naval ships possess one key difference.   Last month I revealed that the so called  Stealth Program  hassucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibilityshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distanceby distorting light waves in its vicinity.   A whole new fleet of Phantom war planes are now going intocrash production that use this principle  and  my friends  all ofthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already beenoutfitted with similar Stealth field equipment   The Stealthprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanesbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment thatgenerates the field.   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE  the secret Stealth navy of the AmericanBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left onearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of worlddomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago  myfriends  but three years ago they lost control of the UnitedStates Military.  Now its the American Bolsheviks who are incontrol  and they are bent on war.   These secret naval installations have precipitated what isbeing called the  Falklands crisis. Topic  2  In AUDIO LETTER R  No. 73 last month I described PROJECT Z   the new Bolshevik three phase strategy for NUCLEARWAR ONE.   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners hereare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war room here inWashington.  Its a plan by which the United States will strikethe first nuclear blow  followed by all out thermonuclear warwith Russia.   Having set off the holocaust  the Bolsheviks here and incertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortablewar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out instalemate  they plan to leave behind the ashes of the UnitedStates and her allies.  Activating Phase  3 of their grandstrategy  they plan to unveil their secret weapons  especiallytheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer andrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know itwill be dead and gone  but in the eyes of the Bolsheviksthemselves  this outcome will constitute victory.   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed twomonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting fornuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982   Time isfast running out.   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can towardwar  but  my friends  the Bolsheviks are not the only runners inthis race.  They have two deadly enemies  both of whom areequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of theBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel  the other enemy is thenew anti Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia  and now these twomutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts incertain ways.   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that alimited  new anti Bolshevik coalition was in the works betweenthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meetingbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva  Switzerland  was a turningpoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality and is responsible for the so called  Falkland crisis  nowdominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this newrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls farshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to besettled between them  but for the time being they have called atruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadlyenemy  the Bolsheviks here in America.   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is toslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that  time is on the side of the Rockefellercartel in certain political movements which I discussed lastsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow down in the nuclear wartimetable will also give more breathing space for additionalanti Bolshevik actions to be implemented.   The joint Rockefeller Russian planners decided by mid Februarythat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential veryquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effectfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.   The exact details of the  PROJECT Z  war plan are not known toeither the Rockefellers or the Russians  but the general outlinesare known to be as I described last month.   It was decided that military action should be devised thatwould undermine Phase  3 of the Bolshevik war plan  that is  theBolshevik controlled secret naval installations and fleets in theSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By workingtogether  the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able todevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group  who built and originally controlled thesebases  provided detailed Intelligence about the best way toattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machineprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable bothsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to beattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave theBolshevik war plan still workable.   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assaulton the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There wasno combination of commandos  frogmen  or other military forcewhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outsideworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off thevery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a differentmatter.  In a way  the greatest asset of South Georgia Island wasalso its Achilles heel.  The extreme isolation which protectedthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert militaryassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and herlong standing claims to the Falkland Islands.   As I mentioned in Topic  1  the Rockefeller cartel hasdominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operativeswere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the governmentmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the FalklandIslands was to be used to provide a ruse  a military cover  toenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentinegenerals were not told everything about the situation by anymeans  but they were told enough to make clear what they were todo.   As an inducement to cooperate  the Argentine leaders werepromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after theshooting was over  the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentinehands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert militaryassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster thetroubled Argentine economy  it was promised that the Rockefellercartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  Withthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act  1 in the joint attackplan.  A group of Argentine scrap metal merchants  of all things landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South GeorgiaIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the oldbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it theyalso raised the Argentine flag over the work site.  The British always nervous about South Georgia Island  promptly reacted asexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship  Endurance  put 22Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore downthe Argentine flag.   The incident provided the desired excuse for the ArgentineJunta to bring the simmering 150 year old Falklands dispute to aboil.  From time to time in the past  Argentina has claimed thatSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administeredthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it nowcame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this fromArgentine leaders  so there was no hint of what was really afoot.   During late March  Argentine military forces startedassembling for an assault on the Falklands.   Nothing new  thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried outthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believedthat they were about to do it again  but on April 2 Argentineforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms  thistime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentinepublic statements emphasized the long standing historical claimsto the Falklands themselves  but just for good measure  the nextday a small Argentine force also seized far off South GeorgiaIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearanceinitially that it was just a side show from Argentinas point ofview  however  the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines wereoverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the jointRockefeller Russian attack plan.   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentineforces  a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base  theteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above thecavernous secret base.  Special high speed drilling equipment wasset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russianmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening April 3  the military high command in London finally learned whatwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was underattack by virtually the only means possible.  The jointRockefeller Russian team were drilling a shaft down through themountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only amatter of time until their drill would break through the ceilingof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made  the nextstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller Russi

Someone just told me that the Old Testament books were translated   into Greek a long time ago     Yes  thats a famous version called The Septuagint.  It was a translation made by Greek Jews.    and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward.     I dont know what youre referring to here.  When the Jersusalem Temple was destroyed  some manuscripts may have been lost  but I think our extant Hebrew manuscripts are as good as our Greek ones.  I dont know about any  originals .The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greekshad a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscripts scrollsand that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated  perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions  or perhaps justas part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changesin power groups  he I dunno .   So  I was just wondering  since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must    have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions  is the Hebrew version of the    Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version     No.  There are a few famous discrepancies  Isaiahs prophecy about a  young woman  was changed into a  virgin   which was how the New Testament writers read it   but not many.Well  perhaps this is the answer then. deleted     If you go to a Jewish bookstore  youll get a Bible translated by Jews  so there will be some differences in interpretation  but the text theyre  translating  from  is basically the same.     If you want to read  the original   you can buy an Interlinear Bible.  That contains the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament  with an English translation written underneath each word.     If you want a Bible with a possibly more original basic text  you can try to find a Samaritan bible.   Good luck   Ive never seen one.   The Samaritans   no  not the Good Samaritans  have their own version of the 5 Books of Moses. They claim the Jewish bible was altered by Ezra.Thanks for the tips.

When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600  everything isfine  but whenever I use it in 800x600  Windows  AutoCAD  GIFs  the screen gets about 1 1 2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screenthere is about a 3 4  bar of black.  The screen isnt cut off  it just squeezeseverything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I canmanually change the V Size on the back  this is a pain in the ass  and it justshouldnt happen anyway.  Ive called Gateway numerous times and they havent been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card  andboth times the new card didnt work at all in my computer.  They even triedto bill me for the first card because they didnt get it back in a couple ofdays  when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeksbefore billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...So  if anyone has had this same problem  please let me know if you know whatto do.  Hell  let me know if you dont have a solution  just so I know Imnot the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.Jude M. Greerjmgree01 starbase.spd.louisville.eduP.S.

Turkey Cyprus Bosnia Serbia Greece  Armenia Azeris ,Nntp Posting Host  herky.cs.uiowa.eduOrganization  University of Iowa  Iowa City  IA  USALines  63  Well  Panos  Mr. Tamamidis   the way you put it it is only the Turks  who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to  believe for somebody trying to be objective.  When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot  blame one side only  there always are bad guys on both sides.  What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway   Do you think it was your right to be there There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 1923.Someone had to protect them. If not us who    I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only  not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.  It is sad that we  both  still are not trying to compromise.  I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the  visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it  was a positive attempt to make the relations better.  Compromise on what  the invasion of Cyprus  the involment of Turkey inGreek politics  the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorialwaters as stated by international law  the properties of the Greeks of Konstantinople  the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake sorry  Aegean.There are some things on which there can not be a compromise.  The Greeks I mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated  people. They have never met me but they know  I am bad person  because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business  and it is  not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals   why the hatred Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly orindirecly is a  bad  person.It is not your nationality that makes you bad  it is your support of theactions of your goverment that make you  bad .People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what youare. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment andas a such you must pay the price.  So that makes me think that there is some kind of  brainwashing going on in Greece.

The       peakups were successful. The observations were executed as       scheduled  and no problems were reported.     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These       observations will help in our understanding of the planets       atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred       close to the last quarter moon  and special arrangements had to be       made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.

Also the Mets  my other least favorite team  loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to behitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lotsof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress onsituational hitting in spring training  the runners LOB will be lowerthis year  probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose andLankford and Zeiles off year .I dont know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and well see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make thedifference.On a side note  a few years ago  5 6   a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied  Fair.

There is absolutely no reason why you cant ask the pharmacist filling the prescription for the  Physicians Package Insert  for the medication when you pick it up at the pharmacy.  Make sure to tell the pharmacist that you want the  Physicians Package Insert   NOT  theIf people are going to do this  I really wish they would tell me first.Id be happy to go over the insert  in the PDR  with them and explaineverything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and thenon the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drugand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probablydidnt even come back for followup because they didnt want to admitthey wouldnt take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them orsomething.  What people dont understand about the inserts is that theyreport every adverse side effect ever reported  without substantiatingthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to sloughliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was tohappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable informationon a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of theAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.There are very few drugs that someone hasnt reported a death from taking.Patients dont realize that and dont usually appreciate the risksto themselves properly.  Im sure Herman is going to  go ballistic  but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have beenreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assumeit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so willrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem forPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients withtools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.I am involved in a research project to do that  with migraine as thedomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questionsabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.For common illnesses  such as migraine and hypertension  this may helpquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with thecomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get askedthings that the patients should have found out from their physicianbut didnt.  Why they didnt isnt always the physicians fault either.Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They wont be as afraid toask the system  we hope.

She is perfectly healthy  had never experienced anything like  this before  and there is no history of seizures in either side of the  family.  All the tests  EEG  MRI  EKG  came out negative so the decision  was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.    Well  we were going along fine and the other morning  April 5  she had  a bowl of another Kellogs frosted kind of cereal  Fruit Loops  I am  embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once  in a while...  So I pour it in her bowl and think  Oh  oh  this is the  same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.   Ten   minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure  to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.......My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group.Just Wednesday night  a mother was telling how she decided to throwall the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year oldsseizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported thatshe did this on Thursday  3 11   he had a seizure on Saturday and thenwent 4 weeks without a seizure    On Easter he went to Grandmas and ate candy  pop   anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She sees sensitivity to nutrasweet  sugar  colors  caffine and corn.  Withcorn she says  he gets very nervous and aggresive.  With my own daughter  age 7    I think she is also sensitive and staysaway from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum  wont eatcandy  prefers an apple to a cookie  doesnt like chocolate and wonteven use toothpaste     Her brother  on the other hand  is a junk foodaddict   Hope this helps.

Why such an ungodly hour   I guess its because the news is not what the government wanted to hear  Either the police officers have been found innocent   or   after a week   the jury is hung ... neither good news from the governments point of  view  as they desparately needed some scapegoats in Los Angeles.Wrong on both accounts. Maybe by making the announcement at 7 00 AM on the west coast  they figure all the rioters will be asleep  giving the troops time to move into place. No one is a  rioter  until they participate in a  riot   which is unlikely to happen  now.Most of the  people  in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to listen to the court announcement. I guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting  eh  Sorry to disappoint you  but this seems unlikely. The Mayor of Los Angeles  in a press conference about 3 00 AM Saturday morning  in announcing that the jury would give its verdict later this morning  just an hour away as I write this  would not say what that verdict is  but I think he was told ... in his press conference he said  anyone rioting will be stopped dead in their tracks ... I dont think he was told.However  his statement was still appropriate. Meanwhile  following the announcement of the jurys verdict  the judge  jury and assorted court personnel will be evacuated from the building via helicopters landing on the roof of the courthouse. They cant  even walk out through the front door with their heads held high. Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  It is not meant to be a source of pride or instant fame. Wont the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake up later today Well  the many  people  who got up early to go to the court to hear the verdict found that justice was served.  Given your dire and cynical predictions  I imagine that it is you who will be surprised.        Patrick Townson

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre amp A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive  optical isolator .. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp  all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowersI use an H11F1   FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals.There is no click  since I put a .1uF cap across the LED.  Distortionmeasurement are very low with mic level  and they went up to 0.03  at a  14 dB line level.  All I did was put the FET in series with one legof the balanced line.  No hums  pops  just audio jumping out of silence.The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150 200ohms with it on.Hey  it works  and works well.Galen Watts  KF0YJ"
Manual Shift Bigots,"Nntp Posting Host  cary112.its.rpi.eduReply To  kensib rpi.eduOrganization  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Troy  NY.Lines  10I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  I believe that automaticsshould only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwisewould not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the sceneryinstead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drivealways doing something  granted it isnt a large movement.  Plus  driving shouldbe FUN   Driving a manual is fun  driving an automatic is a chore.	In the case of shift speed  automatics can be made to shift far fasterthat any human could move a stick.  If I was racing  Id want and automatic.  Fornormal driving go with the manual."

Riding Jacket Recommendations,Nntp Posting Host  me.udel.eduOrganization  Center for Composite Materials University of DelawareLines  36My old jacket is about to bite the dust so Im in the market for a new ridingjacket.  Im looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I wouldlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I cant afford  700 for it right now.Im considering two basic options 1   Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs    due to recent price increases  but Id imagine over  400.    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact    that I can later add the pants  and that it nearly eliminates    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.2   Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new     Hein Gericke FirstGear line  however they may be a bit pricey    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather    are potentially slightly better protection  enhanced pose    value  we all know how important that is      possibly cheaper    than upper Aerostich.Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers  mainly a sizing thing   if leather id prefer a zip out lining  it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich  elbows  shoulders  forearms  possibly back kidney protection  etc.   a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice  ventilation would be a plus  however it must be wearable in cold weather  belowfreezing  with layers or perhaps electrics.Please fire away with suggestions  comments  etc...Steve      Steve Andersen  DoD  0239                               andersen me.udel.edu  302  832 0136                                     andersen zr1.ccm.udel.edu 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250  Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...

Some more about gun control   ,"Organization  Computer Science   Engineering  U. of Washington  SeattleIn article  1qicep obf transfer.stratus.com  cdt sw.stratus.com  C. D. Tavares  writes  In article  1993Apr14.232806.18970 beaver.cs.washington.edu   graham cs.washington.edu  Stephen Graham  writes    In article  1qhpcn b12 transfer.stratus.com  cdt sw.stratus.com  C. D. Tavares  writes     As far as  John Q. Public with a gun   the Supreme Court has already    ruled in cases such as US v. Miller  307 U.S. 175  1939    and US v.    Verdugo Urquidez  110 S. Ct. 1839  1990   that that is EXACTLY what     the amendment protects.  This interpretation can be found as far back    as the Dred Scott case  in 1857.      Its worth noting that US vs. Miller sustained Millers conviction   of possession of an illegal firearm  noting that a sawed off shotgun   was not a proper militia weapon.   No  they noted that no one had CLAIMED that it was a proper militia weapon  despite having been used in at least two wars .  This was true  since neither Miller nor his lawyer appeared before the Court.Did they or did they not sustain Millers conviction  I dont have thetext of the case handy. Yes  shotguns had been used in WWI  the Spanish American War  and theUS Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed offshotgun was  i.e.  a weapon altered to improve concealibility.   Therefore  US vs. Miller supports limited government regulation of    firearms.  Dont go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by  the consequences that you find at the end of it    mainly  that the law abiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia  purpose  from handguns to sawed off shotguns and fully automatic weapons. That  in fact  is what this decision says.You are free to produce evidence that Im not willing to abide withall the implications of this. Just because I dont whole heartedly endorse the NRA position does notmean that I oppose the RKBA. This attitude is what makes the NRAunpopular.

Some more about gun control   ,"Organization  Interactive Media Group   University of Massachusetts at LowellLines  146In article  1993Apr16.010235.14225 mtu.edu   cescript mtu.edu  Charles Scripter  writes      This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me.  According     to the Federalist Papers  a well regulated militia has a well defined      structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.      Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers  Perhaps you should  reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the well regulated malitia.   Here is what is says about its character 	 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry  and of the other classes	 of the citizens  to be under arms for the purpose of going through	 military exercises and evolutions  as often as might be necessary to	 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the	 character of a well regulated militia  It also talks about the  well regulated militia  having a nationallyuniform in structure and disipline.  I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states     	Little more can reasonably be aimed at  with	respect to the people at large  than to have them properly armed	and equipped  and in order to see that this be not neglected  it	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of	a year.But  do you knew how much organization is required to training a largegroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same peopleevery year  provide a basic training to new people so they canbe integrated into the force  and find a suitable location  it requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure anddisipline  and meet once or twice a year to train  how can you claima  well regulated militia  is not well organized.  But I will concide a  well organized militia  is not necessarily a  well regulated militia.  Several people have stated that the  well organized militia  iswhat is defined under 10 USC 311  which states	The militia of the United States consists of all able bodied 	males at least 17 years of age and  except as provided in 	section 313 of title 32  under 45 years of age who are  	or who have made a declaration of intention to become  	citizens of the United States and of female citizents of 	the United States who are commissioned officers of the 	National Guard.This deos define the militia  but were is the adjective  well regulated. 10 USC 311 does not define a  well regualed militia  in any way  shape  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militiaThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the  well regualed militia  as aproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above  ittalk above  disciplining all the militia of the United States  so theyfit the  character of a well regulated militia.   This is what theparagraph states about the associated costs 	It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor 	of the country  to an amount which  calculating upon the 	present numbers of the people  would not fall far short 	of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all 	the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the 	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent 	would be unwise  and the experiment  if made  could not 	succeed  because it would not long be endured.Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is James Madison  Federalist Paper 41  regarding the  General Welfare  clause   	 Nothing is more natural nor common than first	to use a general phrase  and then to explain and qualify it by a	recital of particulars. So the phrase  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed  must either qualify or explain the phrase  a well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state.   The definition of  explain  as stated in  The American HertitageDictionary of the Enlish Language  The New College Edition  1982 is 	1  To make plain or comprehensible  remove obscruity from 	   elucidate   It was the economists who undertook to explain 	   this puzzle 	2  To define  explicate  expound  He explained his plan.	3  To offer reasons for or a cause of  an answer for justify 	   explain an errorThe second phrase clearly does not  explain  the first  thereforethe second phrase must  qualify  the first.  The definition givenfor  qualify  is 	1  To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities	   of  characterize.	2  To make competent or suitable for office  position  or 	   task.	3  To give legal power to  make legally capable.	4  To modify  limit  or restrict  as giving exceptions.	5  To make less harsh or severe  moderate	6  Grammar  To modify the meaning of  a word or phrase Since  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not beinfringed  does not describe  modify or make less harsh anything andit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.By process of elimination it must fall into definition  3.  And since 3 deals with legal power  the same thing the Constitution does  itmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore   the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  gives legal power to the  well regualated militia  and this legal power  shall not be infringed .  I thank you very much Mr Scripter  you have provided me with more evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the peoples right to form well regulate militia  and says very little about the right of an untrained person to  keep and bear  a .50 calibermachine gun.

Moonbase race  NASA resources  why ,Organization  Apple Computer  Inc.Lines  44In article  C5w5un.Bpq zoo.toronto.edu   henry zoo.toronto.edu  HenrySpencer  wrote     The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply  for  more than a brief visit  at least  is low cost transport to Earth orbit.  For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs  you can develop  a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.   Delta Clipper  might be a bit more expensive than this  perhaps  but there are less  ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.   Ah  theres the rub.  And a catch 22 to boot.  For the purposes of acontest  youll probably not compete ifn you cant afford the ride to getthere.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable  withoutdemand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course  if alow priced system existed  there might be demand...  I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encouragelow cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probablybe the hardest to work out.  For example  would you allow Rockwell toloan you the engines   And so forth...  Any plan for doing  sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting  money in a big way.  This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In otherwords  perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology  life support navigation  etc.  could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. You wouldnt want to use the expensive stuff forever  but Id hate to seefolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac  oops  I mean launchsystem comes on line.I guess Id simplify this to say that waste is a slippery concept.  Ifyour goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years  then perhaps itsnot wasted money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under  500million  then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.CraigCraig Keithley             I dont remember  I dont recall  Apple Computer  Inc.

I got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched.  I was doing   most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and   nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.         My question is       	Is there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching   audio  so that there will be  NO  noise of any kind on the audio lines.         I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also  exact part   numbers company names etc. for the relays will help       Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre amp   out level signals   Also  are the clicks you mentioning the big   clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact   bounce   How are you driving the relays   TTL gate output   Switching   transistor   How are the relays connected to what you are driving       Need more specifics to answer your question          As a general rule  no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer  the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary  opening and closing of the path.    The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high  impedance audio circuits a resistive  T  is constructed close to characteristic  impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs  connected to the T  transfers  the audio.    In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used  and the inputs are  shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic  impedance.    Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio  a second contact is used  to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.    Telephone relays are handy  because contacts can be adjusted to  Make before  break and Vica Versa  but I havent seen any of these for years.    Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps  etc.    A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive  optical isolator .. It consists  of a resistive photocell and a lamp  all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is  off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers  passing the audio.  Once again this device in a  T  switches the audio.  Varying  the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and  you have a mixer     Lots of luck        73  Tom                                                                                    Tom Wagner  Audio Visual Technician.

A run scored is just as important as a run  prevented.      This certainly passes the  common sense test  for me  but is there any  statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what  percent is fielding   Id really like to know.  BTW  Sherri  thanks for   the DA data I find it fascinating.Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up totheir potential  they wont need much offensive support.I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the 92 BoSox in the dust.There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners  and three otherpitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their firstor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take themound  the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs .  A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.On the flip side  if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore theiropponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows thatyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.All Im trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitcherslike the Braves have  the offense doesnt need to be as strong.Sam     Dave      Sherri Nichols  snichols adobe.com

If you do get a dial tone  then surely the telco is sending a billfor the line to  someplace  or  somebody . Are you sure that what youare doing is on the level.

outlining of spline surface,"Keywords  spline rasterizationLines  38	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared tobe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering ifanyone on the net has seen this problem and  hopefully  some published solutions to it.	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by tworoughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentiallystarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional  i.e. only extantbetween the edges  but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw the object we 1  fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly  but not	exactly  the same distance along each spline by any reasonable	measure.2  Take each segment  n  along each spline and match it to the nth segment	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.3  Depth sort the triangles4  Take each triangle in sorted order  project onto a 2D pixmap  draw	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge	colored with a special  edge color 	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of theproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps inthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.They involve both rasterization problems and problems resultingfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problemsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in thisarea. Thanks"

Kubota Announcement   ,"Organization  Silicon Graphics  Inc.Lines  123NNTP Posting Host  deadhead.asd.sgi.com   My   comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other   vendors   that supported OpenGL  rather than deal further with SGI.OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great  portableinterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. Itis not  however  an indicator of performance  as that will vary stronglyfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to highperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools  so OpenGLmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms  there is noguarantee that your performance would be comparable.      What I  am  annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that   we  would  be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the   Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.If your sales representative truly mislead you  then you should have avalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGIsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...weunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers  so give it ashot.      Im also annoyed about being sold  several  Personal IRISes at a   previous site on the understanding  that  architecture would be around   for a while  rather than being flushed.As one of the previous posts stated  the Personal IRIS was introduced in1988 and grew to include the 4D 20  4D 25  4D 30 and 4D 35 as clock ratessped up over time. As a rule of thumb  SGI platforms live for about 4 5years. This was true of the motorola based 3000 series  85 89   the PI 88 93   the Professional Series  the early 4Ds   86 90   the PowerSeries parallel systems  88 93 . Individual CPU subsystems running at aparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphicsarchitectures at the high end  GT  VGX  RealityEngine  are released every18 months to 2 years.These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines  they becomealmost archaic after four years  and we have to come out with a newplatform  like Indigo  Onyx  Challenge  which has higher bus bandwidths faster CPUs  faster graphics and I O  and larger disk capacities. If wedont  we become uncompetitive.From the user perspective  you have to buy a machine that meets yourcurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You cant wait to buy  butif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine  ask the Sales Repfor one in writing. If its feasible  they should be able to do that. Someof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them  such asthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000 based Power Seriesmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtaina guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or ChallengeR4400 based 64 bit multiprocessor systems.      Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to   keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line  odd that I found myself   pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books   just before the end of the quarter   but Im just a little tired of   getting boned in the process.   If thats happening  its becausing of misunderstandings ormis communication  not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy ourcustomer base.   Maybe its because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies  so we   arent entitled to a  peek under the covers  as the Big Kids  NASA    for instance  are.  This lab  and I suspect that a lot of other labs   and organizations  doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers   every year  so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis.Most SGI customers are onesy twosey types  but regardless  we rarely give agreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system becauseagain  like a previous post stated  if we pre announced and the scheduleslipped  we would mess up our potential customers schedules  when they werecounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date  andwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financialanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting ourcommitments.   The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the   entire grant period of five years and  in some case  beyond. That   means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I   have the money  not some product that was built  to paraphrase one   previous posters words  to fill a niche to compete with some other   vendor.  Im going to be looking at this box for the next five years.   And every time I look at it  Im going to think about SGI and how I   could have better spent my money  actually  your  money  since were   supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars .   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processortechnologies are arriving every 1 2 years  making a 5 year old computer atleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive natureof the market is demanding that rate of development  so if your timing isreally 5 years between purchases  you have to accept the limited viabilityof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to livewith  but keeping customers happy is the most important  so dont give up we know it.Josh                                                                                      				       					    	Joshua Mogal		       	Product Manager			    	Advanced Graphics Division     	  Advanced Graphics Systems	    	Silicon Graphics Inc.

I have Quicken 6   and its wonderful for some things  but MYM seems to have some features  that Q6 doesnt.  For example  Q6 doesnt seem to be able to handle  monthly automatic deductions from a checking account  you know  a  monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from  my checking account .  Or is there something that Im not doing right   and Q6 can actually do that  Hi     I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of thetwo products.  I am  however   a devoted Quicken user  and I can tell youhow to set up the weekly  monthly  quarterly  yearly transactions.  Firstuse the Memorize feature  CTRL M  to record the recurring transactions. Next  define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactionsand specify the frequency that it should be used  i.e. monthly .  Quickenwill can not automatically make the transactions for you  but now all youdo is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will beentered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder  it willremind you when each transaction group is due.  For example  you could havethree transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month middle of the month  and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.Mike

I think  some  of the  theists will be at a loss  and that is enough reason for me. Because  IN GOD WE TRUST  is a motto on the coins  and the coins are a representation of the government  christians are given ammunition here to slander atheists as unpatriotic.So  we should ban the ammunition   Why not get rid of the guns  And yes  I have heard this used in conversation with christians. Sure  they may fall back on other things  but this is one they should not have available to use.It is worse than others   The National Anthem   Should it be changed too God Bless America   The list goes on... Imagine if the next years set of coins were labeled with the motto     GOD IS DEAD . Certainly  such a statement on U.S. coins would offend almost every christian.  And Id be tempted to rub that motto in the face of christians when debunking their standard motto slinging gets boring.Then youd be no better than the people you despise. Any statement printed on an item that represents the government is an endorsement by the government.Oh  The coin motto is an endorsement of trusting in god.An endorsement  or an acknowledgement   I think gods are things that peopleare proud of  but I dont think the motto encourages belief. I dont particularly feel like trusting in god  so the government IS putting me down with every coin it prints.Is it  ...  For the motto to be legitimate  it would have to read      In god  gods  or godlessness we trust Would you approve of such a motto  Whether the motto was intended to be anti atheist or not  it turns up as an open invitation to use as an anti atheist tool.And removing the tool will solve the problem Or will it increase the problem keith

Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local state forests. For that I was planning to get a backpack rucksack.  The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike  given the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest  approx 12  high  and was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest. Any one have any experiences on such experimentation  Taking the idea further  what would happen if the backpack was fully loaded with a full load  40lbs . Is the load distribution going to  be very severly affected  How will the bike perform with such a load  clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it  with no shifting   do I still increase my chances of surfing I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I takethe shoulder straps on the bag  and hook them around the rear turnsignals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it witha bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.

In article  22APR199300374349 vxcrna.cern.ch  casper vxcrna.cern.ch  CASPER DAVI. PPE  writes     I complained about the US taking the point in Bosnia  when the Europeans    should be doing it     Ken says the Bosnians are morally superior to the Serbians...   This implies both sides are equal.  True  it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim  but that does not mean that victims do not exist.  Yes  victims exist.  There are a staggering number of victims in the world andmore each day.  I think on balance  intervention would create more victims including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US governmentis to protect Americans  I think they serve that role best by staying awayfrom Bosnia and other regional conflicts. Would you  in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germanyeither  and except for small scale resistance and a few larger uprisings  didnot have an army or a government.  These people have been butchering each other for centuries.  When one  side wins and gets what it wants  it will stop.   Yes  but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not be  ethnic cleansed .  The Serbians want to  ethnic cleanse  the Muslims.  It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants  but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent.I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of acolonizing power   driving away and or eliminating the population of anarea they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam  the Iraqisin Kuwait  the Israelis in Palestine  South Africa  etc  etc  etc.  It sucks its ugly  and its saddening.  But it is not genocide.It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim inYugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked  theyshould surrender and evacuate the areas they cant hold.   I said the fixation on Bosnia is due to it being in a European country    rather than the third world    I recall  before we did anything for Somalia   apparent  left wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.I am a staunch Republican  BTW.  The irony of arguing against militaryintervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposedto US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons  although clearly it wasnot nearly as risky. For that matter  this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs.  After all  theyre Christian  and the Muslims are not.  If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us  why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us  Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think Well  one thing you have to remember is  the press likes a good story.   Goodfor business  dont you know.  And BTW  not  everyone  wants to help theside that is less like us.I never said the two sides were morally equivalent  I said neither one isinnocent.There are just too many good reasons to stay away 1  The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders   in any way we do it.  Put another way  we have no assistance to offer the   Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to   promote the idea in anyones mind that the United States is responsible   for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.2  Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.  Full   stop.3  It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish  nor that it   would necessarily help the victims.  It is not clear what the goal is and   at what point any commitment could be ended.

The real question is who what  started the   War. Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab   land            Huh   A war was started when several armies invaded Israel   vowing to drive the Jews into the sea.  Most Jews wanted to live in  peace  and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship.  It depends entirely on how you define war. The actual fighting largely predates the Arab invasions   after all Deir Yassin happened in midApril well before the Arab invasion. As I have said elsewhere Lt Col Lorch has said that Hagana forces were fighting well before the Arabs invaded as in months before. As for Jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely arguable.

Israel does not kill reporters ,Lines  26     Anas Omran has claimed that   the Israelis used to arrest  and sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters.   The assertion by Anas Omran is  of course  a total fabrication.  If there is an once of truth iin it  Im sure Anas Omran can document such a sad and despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran would care to retract this error I would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim  I would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.Why retract your accusation that hes a liar   If Omran retracts his  verbaldiarrohea  doesnt that only prove the liar he  really  is   A retractionwould be pointless   Giving this guy the opportunity to  save face  afteruttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again   I must saythat your style is very impressive  Mark.

Its a great bike  but youd better be damn careful    I got a 1983 as my third motorcycle   ...deleta...  The bike is light for its size  I think its 415 pounds   but heavy for a beginner bike.Heavy for a beginner bike it is  415 pounds it isnt  except maybe insome admans dream.

Very firm to very painful  depending upon time in the saddle.The 1980 and 81 versions had a much better seat  IMO. The bike suffers from the infamous Suzuki regulator problem.  I have so far avoided forking out the roughly  150 for the Suzuki part by kludging in different Honda regulator rectifier units from junkyards.  The charging system consistently overcharges the battery.  I have to refill it nearly weekly. This in itself is not so bad  but battery access is gained only after removing the seat  the tank  and the airbox.My regulator lasted over 100 000 miles  and didnt overcharge the battery.The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though tending to melt their insulation.  I suspect they were underspecified it didnt help that they were well removed from cool air.Battery access on the earlier bikes doesnt require tank removal.After you learn the drill  its pretty straightforward. ...  replacement parts  like all Suzuki parts  are outrageously expensive.Having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles Ill offer a grain of salt to be taken with Dales assessment. ...

SSPX schism  ,Organization  Shell OilLines  99In article  Apr.17.01.11.35.1993.2284 geneva.rutgers.edu  jhpb sarto.budd lake.nj.us  Joseph H. Buehler  writes    Descriptions of true and false obedience   Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account  it is not enough to consider someones compliance or refusal and then say whether they are  obedient  or  disobedient .  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  Im not trying to becontentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdictionand authority  what authority do you rely upon for your decisions What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying thatPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time This is especially true  since Councils of Bishops have basicallystood by the Pope.It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter isdisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition  and also overauthority and discipline.  My question to the supporters of SSPX is this   Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope   assuming that  the Popes position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX  dont jointly make such  choice. If not  this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.If I adopt the view that  Im NOT wrong  I CANT be wrong  andtheres NO WAY Ill change my mind  YOU must change yours   thatIve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority jurisdictionviewing authority as present in each bishop  and in EcumenicalCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation ofthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going intothe merits of the Great Schism  at least the Orthodox agree thata split occurred  and dont paly what appear to be semantic gameslike  Hes the Pope  but we dont recognize that what he doesis effective... .  Words aside  it appears to be a de facto split. So where are we   Are we in another Arian heresy  complete with weak Popes   Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers   Well  the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what  and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the  real traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matterEast and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this  because the Papacy is infallible  so eventually some Pope  will  straighten all this out.I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allowerror in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term. I may be wrong here  Im not Roman Catholic.    What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statementregarding the SSPX situation   Would it be honored   If not  howdo you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility Again  Im not trying to be contentions  Im trying to understand.Since Im Orthodox  Ive got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other. Schism is a superset of disobedience  refusal to obey a legitimate command .  All schismatics are disobedient.  But its a superset  so it doesnt work the other way around  not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests dont comply with the Holy Fathers desires doesnt make them schismatics.It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view thePopes commands as legitimate.  Why   This is a VERY slippery slope.                                        But my problem with this is this  according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders  episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order  the ability to confect the Sacraments.  True enough.                                                   Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it  such as the Pope .  The Society bishops  knowing the traditional theology quite well  take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.One could argue that they are establishing a non geographic jurisdiction.I dont know if thats even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

The  morality we practice is a direct outgrowth of how we excercise that  freedom. You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to  ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known  in both cases.

I feel sure that someday we   or more precisely  our  mindchildren    will spread across space  unless we wipe ourselves out   butI think that  manned  space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do  now .   Anyway  let me quote some of this article  but not all...SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEWMicheal Schrage  writer  consultant  and research associate at MIT At 35  Americas Space Age wont have to suffer through the angst of amidlife crisis.The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies nolonger define our times  and the public has grown weary of the multibillion dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economicrewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of Americas scienceand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not ameaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate  ourtechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversionpolicy.  To be sure  America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing   cheap deep space probeswould be nice too   but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations  it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over  30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program   from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station   was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism   not a coherentvision or cost effective sensibilities   determined multibillion dollarspace budgets.Indeed  with few notable exceptions  such as Voyager  the post Apolloera is the story of the gold plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration  it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of Americastechnological prowess.  The space station budget has   rightly   beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda....... I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happennow   says Bruce Murray  a Caltech professor who ran NASAs JetPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.   Weve put off a lot of things we shouldnthave.... I would rather see a  10 billion NASA doing well than a 40 billion one filled with white elephants.

I caught a glimpse of something silver headed for my left foot   and    jerked it up about a nanosecond before my bike was hit HARD in the   left    side.  When I went to put my foot back on the peg  I found that it   was not    there   I pulled into the nearest parking lot and discovered that I   had been    hit by a wire wheel type hubcap from a large cage   This hubcap   weighed    about 4 5 pounds   The impact had bent the left peg flat against the   frame    and tweeked the shifter in the process.  Had I not heard the   approaching    cap  I feel certian that I would be sans a portion of my left foot.

Mitchell  writes    Slavery makes economic sense  it NEVER makes MORAL sense  when human   muscle power is an economically valuable asset. Agricultural slavery might   have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper  but no   further  reapers are cheaper than slaves  and dont have to be fed during   the winter.     This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First  agricultural   slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south  slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco  sugar  and rice  all  of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.And of course  in states like Kentucky and Virginia  not well suited tolarge scale plantations  slave labor was used to make one of the most valuable agricultural products of all  more slaves.  In some ways  thistreatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifyingaspect of American slavery.  Second  although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to  reduce the demands for labor eventually  it was only in the 1940s   the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated  the labor intensive character of the operation  long after the  first  mechanical cotton reaper  was invented.This is an interesting question.  Steinbecks _Grapes of Wrath_ published in the 1930s   uses agricultural mechanization of cottonproduction in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evictedfrom the land.

Zane  Rescue us from Simmons  ,Organization  University of California  San DiegoLines  120Distribution  naNNTP Posting Host  cogsci.ucsd.eduSummary  oh please  its way too early to get upset.Mamatha Devineni Ratnam  mr47  andrew.cmu.edu  writes  So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.Whatever you say.  I think its just 12 games into the season myself  soIm going to wait a bit before calling names. 2  I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. Now Ottos latest debacle has restored Simmons reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his 92 form when he had the ALs highest ERA among starters. Four our sake not Teds sake   I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah  right.I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher  and I have noidea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand  I expect him torelease Otto if he doesnt turn things around pretty fast.   BTW Ottos game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22  which points outa problem with the method since Ottos performance was infinitely bad and excruciatingly prolonged.  3  Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. But considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons  they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. I think Merceds rookie year was a bit flukey  but arent you willing togive him some more at bats  and Tomlin a few more starts  before actingso gloomy  4  Walk  Well  he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think  that Walk desrved his contract.No he didnt.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever  and whenthe league finally realizes this  it wont be pretty at all. 8  The Rookie batters  Well  Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that  their excellent performance hasnt been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.Dont be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele  whichwas a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.Meanwhile  Im not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as asix year free agent before the 1992 season. 9  Rookie Pitchers  Worse than expected  especially Cooke.Twice through the rotation  and youve given up   Yikes. 10  Slaught  How come he wasnt given a contract extension last year   Now his value has increased immensely.But so has his age  at least in baseball terms.  The useful half lifeof a 34  year old injury prone catcher cant be much longer than a year. 11  Lonnie Smith   Well  Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.But he wanted to be a Dodger  and felt he had something to prove after hisdisastrous 1992.  I dont think there was any chance for the Bucs to signhim. Lets see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. He certainly wasnt last year. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year he wont be an asset.  He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.Hey  thats the  Skates Smith  package deal.  Anybody who acquiresLonnie for his defense or base running  particularly at this stage  isa real weirdo. 12  Management  BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful argument in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.If thats the goal of the team ownership  than I dont see why Sauergets a zero for making his boss happy.  I dont know what he has orhasnt said about revenue sharing  so I cant comment there. 13  Alex Cole fiasco.    stuff deleted  Ironically  the biggest accomplishment of Simmons tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  that he gave him away in the expansion draft. Its annoying  but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for themto retain Jeff King  it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile  I thinkbigger accomplishments of Simmons tenure were getting some value forJohn Smiley  not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretchlast year  drafting well in 1992  letting the rookies show somethingin 1993.  Foley  Smith  and Candelaria were acquired to be replacementparts  which means that even if fail it hasnt done serious damage tothe Bucs future. 14  Compensatory draft picks for Bonds  Forget it. The pirates can rant  and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now  the issue is still  being appealed.Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case   Inever heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in onthis  Now  if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots  nothing else will.Im not sure who was the idiot in this case  so I dont know who toblame.  It might have been Doug Danforth  after all.  In fact  I seriously  suspect it was Doug Danforth  who has shown hiswillingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun ispointed at his feet. btw  Ive wondered whether my latest posts have been gettingoff site  so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can seethis  would he drop me a short note  jking

Building a UV flashlight,"Organization  RANDLines  26Nntp Posting Host  ives.rand.orgIn article  C5r6Lz.n25 panix.com  jhawk panix.com  John Hawkinson  writes  One other thing  a friend of mine mentioned something about near UV light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light. Does anyone know what he was referring to I dont want to get into a semantic argument  but contrary to some otherpostings  near UV light   is   actual UV light.   The  near  means thatit is close to the visible spectrum  i.e. of relatively long wavelength  not that it is  nearly UV.    Im sure you can figure out now just what far UV  is. Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in thenear end of the spectrum  such that a filter can be used to remove thevisible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources aregoing to require gas  probably mercury vapor  discharge tubes  such asfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor .  Be careful  though  strong UVsources can cause physiological damage  especially to the eyes.  Theshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.It wouldnt project a beam like a flashlight  but replacing the tubesin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relativelycheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough tobe useful  but not dangerously so.		 Ed Hall		edhall rand.org"

HE 	Homeland  First Nagarno Karabagh was Armenians homeland today HE 	Fizuli  Lacin and several villages  in Azerbadjan  HE 	are their homeland. Cant you see the HE 	the   Great Armenia  dream in this Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh  to the Black Sea  to theMediterranean  so if you use the term  Greater Armenia  use it with care.

The last move was the  HE 	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees  trying to HE 	escape the from Lacin  a city that was  given  to the Kurds HE 	by the Armenians. It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh by removing the Armenians  When the president of Azerbaijan  Elchibey  came to power last year  he announced he would be be  swimming in Lake Sevan  in Armeniaxn  by July . Well  he was wrong  If Elchibey is going to shell the Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam  his people will pay the price  If Elchibey is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price  If Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of Kelbajar  his people will pay the price. It also seems other non Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood theyare next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just look at the situation with the Lezgians.About the Kurds...what Kurds  According to the Azerbaijani government  there are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Cant they make up their minds  Oh I see  there are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds  And anyway  this  60 Kurd refugee  story  as have other stories  are simple fabrications sourced in Baku  modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border with Iran  and the ridiculous story of the  intercepting  of Armenian military conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by somebody unknown  from Armenian into Azeri Turkish  submitted by an unnamed  special correspondent  to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate  h        However  I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane  h        to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one h        that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane h         carrying humanitarian aid  bound to ARMENIA. h No  Henrik  these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked. HE 	Dont speak about things you dont know  8 American Cargo planes HE 	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities HE 	announced that they were going to search these cargo  HE 	planes 3 of these planes returned to its base in Germany. HE 	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of HE 	of the other 3 planes  Not hard to guess  is it  It was sure not HE 	humanitarian aid.....Your  facts  in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey have been either searched  re routed or confiscated. Some American planeswere searched  others were re routed  others were untouched. Rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkeyfor the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat wasconfiscated  other shipments were exchanged with  crap  and dirt  thenshipped to Armenia. U.S. planes dont have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway  U.S. planes can fly over Georgia  whichthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid Turkish military.  HE 	Search Turkish planes  You dont know what you are talking about.

No wonder you are so confused  HE 	Turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons HE 	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan HE 	it self  not the Karabag province.

Gospel Dating,Lines  73Benedikt Rosenau writes  The argument goes as follows  Q oid quotes appear in John  but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However  they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such  and not an entirely different source.Assuming you are presenting it accurately  I dont see how this argumentreally leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John  Im not sureexactly what is referred to here  but Ill take for granted the similarityto the Matt. Luke  Q  material  IS different  hence  one could have almostany relationship between the two  right up to John getting it straight fromJesus mouth. We are talking date of texts here  not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark  Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark  and Luke that of Matthew  and probably that of Mark .The version of the  usual theory  I have heard has Matthew and Lukeindependently relying on Mark and  Q .  One would think that if Luke reliedon Matthew  we wouldnt have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing. As it is assumed that John knew the content of Lukes text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming  admittedly.This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible thatyou could point me to a reference  Id be grateful.  Unfortunately  I havent got the info at hand.  It was  I think  in the late  70s or early 80s  and it was possibly as old as CE 200. When they are from about 200  why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three Because it closes up the gap between  supposed  writing and the existingcopy quit a bit.  The further away from the original  the more copies can bewritten  and therefore survival becomes more probable.  And I dont think a  one step removed  source is that bad.  If Luke and Mark  and Matthew learned their stories directly from diciples  then I really  cannot believe in the sort of  big transformation from Jesus to gospel  that  some people posit.  In news reports  one generally gets no better  information than this.  And if John IS a diciple  then theres nothing more to be said. That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.Im not really impressed with the  theology  argument.  But Im reallypointing this out as an  if .  And as I pointed out earlier  one cannot makethese arguments about I Peter  I see no reason not to accept it as anauthentic letter. One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants  which isnot so bad. In other words  one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.But the statement of divinity is not in that section  and in any case  itsagreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.

Function Generator,"Originator  dgj2y kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDUOrganization  University of VirginiaLines  35	I have a new scope and I thought Id save a few bucks bybuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhileI noticed two things about the function generator. For one  thereseems to be a bias even when the pull offset is pushed in. That is I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans somerandom 50mV bias.	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn outputwont go below about 1V p p. I am a student   you may have guessedfrom my previous posts    and I often have to measure the inputimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits havemaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most haveinput impedances in the 10s of Kohm range. The thing is  in order touse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thingreasonable. Then  of course  to measurethe input impedance of mycircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it  but nowwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. Its kind ofa pain in  the ass.	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that couldsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generatorinput  lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is somelow  unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factorof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp  but Idlike to have this box not be active.	Any quick ideas. The scopes not broken. For other reasons Ihad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. Thefunction generator was the same way on that one  too.			please help as I am feeling very stupid 			today 						dave 						dgj2y virginia.edu"

They are not able to use NuBus.

What is the fundamental reason for   this   I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages  Im sure Ive seen them advertised occassionally   but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.   Of course  it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...   NuBus technology isnt a special Apple Proprietry thing  I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments     so there is no problem building an expansion box.Apple uses the IEEE Nubus 90 standard for their 32 bit backplane bus.

Watch from where   Two miles away   Far enough away that whatever      really happenned must be explained through the vengeful filter of      a humiliated agency that said  quote    Enough is enough.           Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people      come out with their hands up several weeks ago.        It didnt happen.    And who is responsible for it not happening   Certainly not the children.  Koresh was calling the shots.  He was   talking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely    there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.  The FBI and Koresh were calling the shots.  And there were very sane reasons  for keeping the children  if they let them go  the parents would NEVER see them  again.  That is not an easy choice  in spite of you cold attitude about it.       scenario that is simplest and most plausible.  I do not generally        believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely        scenarios.            The FBI sent letters to Martin Luther Kings wife insinuating      that MLK was having an affair   Again  please tell us exactly      how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government.          More than someone who would not release children from the compound.        Obviously.  You are an authority worshiper.    Not at all.  Are you a Koresh worshiper I am a constitution worshiper.  You quite obviously eat anything the  authorities feed you  without doubt  which makes you no different that a Koresh  worshiper       I.e.  more than David Koresh Vernon Howell  Jesus Christ .     I saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in      1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult.      Give me a camera  and time with you  and I can present excerpts that show  you     to be a cult leader.  Guarenteed.     Thanks for my laugh of the day   Definitely a very silly supposition.  If you do not believe this  you are truly naive.  It is not only possible  it  is easy.  I worked in the broadcast profession  at a network station  in the  late 70s  I know what Im saying here.  Embarrasing footage is easy to get  add  a little sinister music  and the right voice over  and Ill have you mother  agreeing to commit you.   You should at least view the whole     documentary before you claim it as a source.    I would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also   had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically   confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the   compound in 1992.  The news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position.  Do you  think they would show excerpts which disproved their points      I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair.  I think they      bungled it badly from the start.  But I dont think they are      responsible for the fire  which started in two different places.      Two places  eh   You saw this   Or did the wonderful FBI tell you this      I saw one place.    I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site.  A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two   story window shown on the tv coverage.  The reports of multi starts came solely from the FBI.  Anyone observing the  fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point  of fire.  Which spread across the compound as a uniform rate.       The BATF is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair.       But to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is        ludicrous.            I suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to      risk small arms fire to get some good footage.  These people      were told to get the hell out of camera range.  Why       Couldnt answer this one  eh   This is the most important question of all   it     is the root cause of all the other suspicion.    I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press   in Grenada and how that set the precedent  but decided it wasnt worthy   of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot  you can bet his family   would sue the government for letting him into the danger area.No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation.  They know the  dangers.  Remember  the BATF invited the initial coverage. And how about a  simple  remote controlled  camera or two   There were ways to provide media  access.  The FBI obviously just didnt want any.    The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldnt flee   a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took   to burn down.  Or why didnt they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was   first introduced   I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.  I can find several.  Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the  barricades.  Flames blocking exits to the saferooms. Perhaps the gun shots were  from the FBI  keeping them pinned in   Who knows        Jim  jmd handheld.com                                                                                Im always rethinking that.

A few years ago I saw that famous study that showed a  10  failure rate  for condoms.  The same study showed a 20  failure rate for abstinence    That is  adult couples who relied on abstinence to prevent pregnancy got pregnant in alarming numbers  they didnt have the willpower to abstain.  And were thinking that this will work with high school kids   I am told that Planned Parenthood SIECUS style  values free  methods  thatteach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make  choices  actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a whileback and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  Thearticle included sources to contact for information on research verifyingthese statements  and an outstanding source for info on acquiringabstinence related curricula even in single copy quantities for home use.The same research produced the results that abstinence related curriculawere found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it isreasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancyrate.The difference is not in  contraceptive technology  but in the values taughtto the children.  The PP SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they havelegitimate choices  while the abstinence related curricula taught them thatthey did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is thevalues system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior ofthese kids.Despite the better track record of abstinence related curricula  they aresuppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to thatdesired.  Question for further discussion  as they say in the textbooks    Why dontwe teach  safe drug use  to kids  instead of drug abstinence   Isnt itbecause we know that a class in  how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ touse drugs  would increase drug use   Why isnt  drug abstinence education barred from schools because it teaches  religion    Arent we abandoningthose children who will use drugs anyway  and need instruction in their safeuse    Joe Kellettjkellett netcom.com

Thank you     Dave Carvell  pk115050 wvnvms.wvnet.eduFirst  let me offer you my condolences.  Ive had kidney stones 4 times and I know the pain she is going through.  First  it is best that she see a doctor.  However  every time I had kidney stones  I saw my doctor and theonly thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for aurinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stonesare extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable  so we just waited itout.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway  if sheabsolutely wont see a doctor  I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhapsan over the counter sleeping pill.  But  I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x rayed to make sure there is not a serious problem.Steve

Why not give  1 billion to first year lo,Organization  Apple Computer  Inc.Lines  80In article  1993Apr21.150545.24058 iti.org   aws iti.org  Allen W. Sherzer wrote     In article  C5sJDp.F23 zoo.toronto.edu  henry zoo.toronto.edu  Henry Spencer  writes       This prize isnt big enough to warrent developing a SSTO  but it is    enough to do it if the vehicle exists.     Actually  there are people who will tell you that it  would  be enough   to do SSTO development  if done privately as a cut rate operation.  Of   course  they may be over optimistic.    In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of  I think their  cost estimates are a bit over optimistic. If nothing else  a working SSTO  is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience  base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as  much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the  3G to  5G  range.  For the purpose of a contest  Id bet some things could be cut.  Like fuelfor re entry  any kind of heat shielding  etc.  etc.  Even still  if thecontest participants had to fund DC 1 development  it probably wouldnt beworth it to develop DC 1  just for the contest .  Just give me the cheapestheaviest lift man rated  or at least under 6 or so Gs  booster...  If Idont have to pay for DC 1 development  great   Ill use it.But back to the contest goals  there was a recent article in AW ST about alow cost  its all relative...  manned return to the moon.  A GeneralDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV   Shuttle to lift a Centaur upperstage  LEV  and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering twounmanned payloads to the lunar surface  followed by a manned mission. Total cost   US was  10  13 billion.  Joint ESA    NASA project was  6  9billion for the US share.I didnt find a mention of how long the crew could stay  but Id bet thatits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metrictonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload  hitch a ride in the crewhabitation module  no return trip...   and toss in a few more tonnes forthe additional consumables to last another 11 months  then you  might  beable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes  and in case its not obvious thats a wild ass guess .  A pretty boring visit  since every trip outdoorseats up a bit of LOX.  And Im not certain if a home brewed  orcollege brewed  life support system could last a year.  But lets roundthis up to 19.4 tonnes  convient  since the GD plan talks about 9.7 tonpayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs  twoLEVs  two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for ayear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper better way ofdelivering 15 20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade   Anyonehave a more precise guess about how much a years supply of consumables andequipment would weigh And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable   Or is it discardedto burn up on return to LEO   If its not discarded  could it be refueled  Henry  Do you know anything about the GD LEV   I noted that it uses RL 10engines.  Arent they reusable restartable   Would a LEV fit in a DC 1  Ive forgotten  if I ever knew  what the cargo bay dimensions are for theDC 1.All in all  Im not certain that the single goal prize of staying on themoon for a year is wise and or useful.  How about   A prize for the firstnon government sponsered unmanned moon landing  then another for a mannedmoon landing  then yet another for a system to extract consumables fromlunar soil  another for a reusable earth moon shuttle  and so forth.  Findsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goalmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appearedto win.  And for those that didnt give up  I find something a little scaryabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  Idlike to see as much a reward for co operation as for competition.Lastly  about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was anEnglish space magazine that had an on going discussion about moonbases onthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the humanbody produced  how much lunar material itd need for protection from solarflares  etc.  Unfortunately I dont remember the name of this magazine.

Letter to a Liberal Colleague    L  Neil Smith,Distribution  usaNntp Posting Host  blanca.lance.colostate.eduOrganization  Colorado State University  Fort Collins  CO  80523Lines  147Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE AUTHORS NOTE    Adrian     name changed to protect the guilty    and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house. Dear Adrian   Im way behind schedule on my current book again  so this reply to your note    criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership    will necessarily consist mostly of assertions youre free to believe  or not  I can back with evidence and logic Ive neither time nor energy to present now.  Ive written fully on this topic before and will again in the future.  When I do  Ill make sure you get copies.  There are many arguments I might make  from the futility and danger of delegating self defense to the police  see Don Kates in the Jan. 10  1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL  to the real effect of prohibition  shifting consumers from newly outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed off shotguns or homemade bombs  but Ill limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note.  First  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Second  publication of some latter day  scientific study  doesnt alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview    annoying you so much in the process    were lying.  Third  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Fourth  as often happens with these things  the  study  doesnt support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway  but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies  omissions  and distortions.  Fifth  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Sixth  the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions  Carl Bakal  author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS  even confessed to it publicly  makes the value of this present  study  dubious  to say the least.  Seventh  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Eighth  given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction   you should be better aware than most people how  progress     in designing  studies  to prove whatever you want    outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create  studies   proving  that pornography causes crime.  More naive  and probably more honest  efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary.  Ninth  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Tenth  another reason to doubt all such  studies  is that human behavior  as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates  is fartoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The attempt to do so    and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo information    is wrecking our civilization.  Eleventh  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Twelfth  the  study  is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide  which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right  sometimes with ancillary social benefits.  If anything  perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense.  Thirteenth and finally  the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article  whatever their shortcomings  and they are many   are correct in this instance   the  study  is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and Constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  And because of that  Adrian  even if the  study  were valid  it wouldnt deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however  whenever  and wherever he or she desires without asking anybodys permission. In this Im ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves  whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun  while they still can .  Before the 68 Gun Control Act  most of the  shooting fraternity  viewed handguns  incorrectly  as it turned out  as inaccurate  ineffective toys.  There probably werent six million of them in the whole country.  Now  thanks to Kennedy  Metzenbaum  the Bradys  and their ilk    AMERICAS GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM    we probably manufacture at least that many every year.The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control  et al. are perfectly aware of this    so I guess youll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are.  Look   gun making isnt an arcane or difficult art  and by the way  its easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference  the self loading pistol  is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further .  Even if it were difficult  there are already a quarter billion firearms in America  with an estimated  half life  of 1000 years    possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna be around a long time  Adrian  whether you like it or not.As for me  to paraphrase Elmer Keith  regardless of what the law provides or any court decides  Im always going to be armed.  And I will always work to see that others are  as well.  The bad news is that there are thousands more    perhaps even hundreds of thousands    where I come from.  We cant be stopped by passing laws  we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and    given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics    perhaps more efficiently.

You could present the paragraph above to virtually any member  of the non motorcycling public and theyll buy right into it.    Just about any argument you can produce in favor of banning helmetless  riding can be used to argue in favor of banning motorcycles.  Its just a matter of degree.Thats absurd  That statement must therefore say that any argument in favorof seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argumentfor lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgumentin favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous there wouldnt be any normal human activity left to do  therefore it isa non seqitur.Also  even though most people do not ride motorcycles  they do boat  sail jetski  climb  ski  fly parachute  hang glide  glide  bungee jump  bike skate  rollerblade  skateboard  play rugby  ouch   mow the lawn  rewirethe basement  operate heavy machinery   and do a host of other dangerousthings that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.Your little homily applies to all those things  and the general publicbuying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activitywould be next is unlikely.

Newspapers censoring gun advertisements,"Lines  88Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store  a very wellstocked firearms store  I discovered a printed document that was being distributed by the good folks who work there.  Traders  BTW  is located inSan Leandro  CA.Granted  the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders  but in thebig scope of things  I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helpingto this cause.Anyway  here it is NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIPAre you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life  whats good foryou  whats not  and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in theiradvertisments The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads   which is why you no longersee the ads that Traders  San Leandro  has run for many years.These ads were run for the law abiding honest citizens who own firearms forsporting use or self protection.  They certainly have the right to do so  underthe Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor  yet refuse torun legitimate gun ads  please send a letter to the editors indicating yourdispleasure over their censorship doctrine.Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.

An Anecdote about Islam,Organization  Mantis Consultants  Cambridge. UK.X Newsreader  rusnews v1.01Lines  32jaeger buphy.bu.edu  Gregg Jaeger  writes   Why would the Rushdie case be particularly legitimate  As Ive said  elsewhere on this issue  Rushdies actions had effects in Islamic  countries so that it is not so simple to say that he didnt commit  a crime in an Islamic country.Actually  it is simple.A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the bordersof X at the time when C was committed.  It doesnt matter if the physicalmanifestation of C is outside X.For instance  if I hack into NASAs Ames Research Lab and delete all theirfiles  I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom.  If the US authoritieswish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law  they have no automaticright to do so.This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sitesin Holland.  Holland had no anti cracking legislation  and so it was viewedas a  hacker haven  by some US system administrators.Similarly  a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographicmaterial which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting inBritain  they would be committing a crime.  But they are not  they arebroadcasting from Denmark  so the British Government is powerless to doanything about it  in spite of the apparent law breaking.Of course  Im not a lawyer  so I could be wrong.  More confusingly  I couldbe right in some countries but not in others...mathew

These electric fields change with locationand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applyingexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistancescaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures willbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundredyears old  but not a popular activity.  Perhaps  except in the case of a fewtissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes  it is hard to reduce theinvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are somehints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speedingthe healing of broken bones  but not understood why.Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism.

Marlin fans,Expires  Fri  30 Apr 1993 04 00 00 GMTOrganization  Virginia Commonwealth UniversityKeywords  MFSummary  Marlin fansLines  23I was watching the Dodgers Marlins game yesterday and a couple ofthings impressed me.  First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami  it had a summeratmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Fieldin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy andbundled up fans.  The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys gals I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed tothe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering  I thought it was theAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking witha lot of baseball fans in other cities.  Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansionteams bring back some excitement.  Well find out Friday how DenverBronco fans respond.

Patrick  Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types.  Hence  they did help build the league  although they were not great players themselves.  Punch Imlachs contributions as a coach and GM were far greater thanthose of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy afterhim   Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because theywere powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build theleague but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.Are we going to honour those who contributed to the leagues evolutionor are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the sport itself     	I agree that a name is a name is a name  and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans  then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the  arena  door by being uncomplicated  then lets do so.  Once we have them  they will realize what a great game hockey is  and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.  I cant disagree with you here.  The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.  All of the aforemen   tioned used the game of hockey to make money.  Can you imagine a Pocklington  division   A Ballard division   Or how about a Green division  	No  I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes  hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe  for example  was a classy individual  from what I have heard . What have you heard   The Major was the  definitive  little asshole   Heoriginated the phrase  if you cant beat em in the alley you cant beatem on the ice.   That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think  by chance that Don Cherry is a classy individual  	Also  isnt the point of  professional  hockey to make money for all those involved  which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due  and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice  so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult  in the form of lesser recognition  to injury  less money than was deserved .   The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on  andthat is   it is the players that are what make the game great and not thepeople who put them on the ice Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunchis the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.

Pick it up  hold it about a foot from your face and look closely   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions  its an AR 15  if   it has three  its an M 16.  There are numerous internal differences   as well  but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see   them  they are not valid in this discussion.  So  in conclusion    there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR 15   from an M 16 except at close  very close  range.

As a provider of a public BBS service   arent you bound by law to gurantee      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS  if police comes      with sufficent authorisation   I guessed this would be  a basic condition      for such systems.  I did run a bbs some time ago  but that was in Switzerland The US doesnt yet have many laws covering BBSs   theyre not common carriers theyre not phone companies  theyre just private machines or servicesoperated by businesses.  Theres no obligation to keep records.As Perry Metzger points out  if the police come with a search warrant you have to let them see what the warrant demands  if it exists and they generally can confiscate the equipment as  evidence  which is not Constitutionally valid  but were only beginning todevelop court cases supporting us .  A court MAY be able to compelyou to tell them information you know  such as the encryption passwordfor the disk   there arent any definitive cases yet  since its a newsituation  and there probably arent laws specifically covering it.But the court cant force you to  know  the keys  and there are nolaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keysfor their own files without giving them to you.Even in areas that do have established law  there is uncertainty.There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business recordssubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business restriction law so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.The US doesnt have laws forcing you to keep your records in English and these were the originals of the records.  HE didnt speak Hebrew and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Dont think theywere able to do much about it.It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customersbased on race  religion  national origin  gender  or sexual preference it probably hasnt been tested in court  but it seems like a plausibleextension of anti discrimination laws affecting other businesses.

I tried gazingat CB750s and 900 customs  but each time I sadisticallypictured them being hurled off of large precipice I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering andtaking holiday snaps  but I cant figure that part out .What am I to do   Everytime I read a .sig containing some spoked wheel wonder  I shudder and feel pity thatthe poor soul has suffered enough.  I imagine the ownerscrapping out his  or her  living in a discarded Maytagrefridgerator box  tucked in next to their CX500.Im hoping for some deliverance.

Being right about messiahs,"Lines  41In article 2262 geneva.rutgers.edu  Desiree_Bradley mindlink.bc.ca  Desiree Bradley  writes   I must have missed the postings about Waco  David Koresh  and the Second  Coming.  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing  unless the  person claiming to be IT is obviously insane One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim  they arewrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning  I think that is theright chapter  anyway it is close and I dont have a Bible at work tocheck with.  and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about hisimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then laterhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of  I willbe in you and you will be in me.    Again I cannot provide the exactquote or citation.   Anyway  my understanding of this is thatthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inwardevent  Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.If you look for a person you will be deceived.It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that wouldbe a political or military leader and so didnt recognize Jesus whenhe came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems tobased on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking overthe world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot likewhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasnt like that andI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.Oh and by the way  I dont expect it to happen once.  There is no oneSecond Coming  there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christcomes into someones heart  Christ has come again.Peace Will.

Final Solution in Palestine  ,Lines  89  O.K.  its my turn          DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA     I am sick and tired of this DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO  it simply cant be proven as part of their plan   May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant  1964 _.  It maynot use the exact words as quoted above but Im sure many will agree that thesame message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to findthe precise section s  but you can do the research for now  I hope .  I alsorealize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_  to the Western media only but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exactintentions on this issue.  Therefore  as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_still stands as the  Bible   so to speak  of the mainstream PalestinianNational movement   Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith As a staunch pro Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOTinfluenced my opinions on the Arab Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similarconclusion on the Palestinian National movement  the PLO in most cases .  BBdoes not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who sharemy views.  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in  as far as I can get from the Arab media  is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its  mostly Muslim  inhabitants. What 1948 situation   A negative situation I presume   Is this the same situation  when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow theJews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM   Was this an example ofQuranic law being exercised   If not  I have another suggested reading foryou... get into the  soc.culture.arabic  newsgroup where the posters have beendebating the topic  Jews in the Quran   and may I remind you the people doingthe debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Quran .You will find that Jews arent really viewed positively by the Quran  to putit lightly .  So how do you think Jews  or any other non Islamic religion  willbe treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Quran   I thinkthe 1948 1967  situation  in Jerusalem will return  at best    What do youthink  However  whoever committed crimes against humanity  torture  blowing up their homes  murders ...  must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.All I have to say to that is  once again  see s.c.a    Jews in the Quran  andthink again.   Freedom of choice  is  definitely  not an option in Quraniclaw especially for non Muslims and ALL women   Remember the Gulf War   Im sureyou saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia  an Islamicstate .  As for the PLO  I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafats mind. Probably nothing   Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethrenthat the _Covenant_ is  null and void  without getting assassinated himself  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super power in the region  the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state   Religion. In conclusion  Ahmed  you should go to the library and find the _PalestinianNational Covenant  1964 _ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way  RedpathLibrary DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when Iwas doing my research.

The arrogance of Christians,Lines  54  Ive just read Carols response and I just had to get into this.  Ive  got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say                                                                            what they say.                 Joe  just cause you say they arent subject to interpretation doesntnecesarily make it so.  Thats  your   interpretation  of these texts.  They are 2 Peter 1 20 21  2 Timothy 3 16 17  and  Galatians 1 11 12.  2 Peter 1 20 21But know this first of all  that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation  for no prophecy was ever made by an act ofhuman will  but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20.Apparantly its not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.2 Timothy 3 16 17All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching  forreproof  for correction  for training in righteousness  that the man ofGod may be adequate  equipped for every good work.Galations 1 11 12For I would have you know  brethren  that the gospel which was preachedby me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man  nor was I taught it  but I receieved it through a revelation of JesusChrist.When I read these passages  it was not immediately clear to me whatevery phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possibleconnotations of words  what the intent of the author may have been wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the same meaning  I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your are not interpreting Scripture as you read  theres probably nothing I can say to change your mind.  But I think its naive to think that our culture  experiences  education  do not affect everything we read.  Also  based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges  people if they follow him  see Acts 17 29 31 and John 5 21 27  and that  those who reject Jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke   see John 12 47 50   then Jesus words are true and do not need  interpretation  nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word  if it had to be interpreted.In college  I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go toany Christian bookstore  there are scores of books on interpreting andunderstanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary  there are an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time and energy on it.Carol Alvincaralv auto trol.com

The pill for Deer   No Hunting,Distribution  usa  1qfrhbINNo80 cae.cad.gatech.edu Lines  27In article  1qfrhbINNo80 cae.cad.gatech.edu   vincent cad.gatech.edu  VincentFox  says   ...  this measure as it will prevent the evil Bambi killers from hunting  and another will fight it for the interference with Nature that it is.Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve thevarious states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundredsof millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. Imsure that  to attain sure a lofty  humane  liberal and ecologically not to mention politically  correct goal  the environmental and animalrights groups individuals supporting such a measure would be more thanwilling to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increasedtaxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident thatthese same entities  given their noteworthy record in the area of socialresponsibility and respect for private property  would feel morallyand ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire thehundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private handssolely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner s . Todo less than this would place these same groups individuals inthe ethically untenable  to say nothing of environmentally andpolitically incorrect  position of sanctioning the logging andsubsequent development and urbanization of these former privatehunting lands  which would no longer be useable by  or of anybenefit to  the landowner s  in such a capacity.W.

christians and aids,"Organization  Applied Research Laboratories  University of Texas at AustinLines  98In article  Apr.8.00.57.49.1993.28271 athos.rutgers.edu  marka travis.csd.harris.com  Mark Ashley  writes  In article  Apr.7.01.55.33.1993.22762 athos.rutgers.edu  kevin pictel.pictel.com  Kevin Davis  writes   Many Christians believe in abstinence  but in a moment will be overcome  by desire.  We all compromise and rationalize poor choices  sin .  Last  week I was guilty of anger  jealousy  and whole mess of other stuff   yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with AIDs.  To even  suggest that AIDS is  deserved  is ludicrous.  Some rules are made because at some point man is too stupid to know better. Yet  eventually man learns. But only after getting a lesson from experience.Yes  its important to realize that all actions have consequences and that  rules  were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a disease  is a  punishment  for certain types of sin I think is taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth diseasefor lying  would any of us have mouths left   What if we developedblindness every time we lusted after someone or something   I daresay all of us would be walking into walls.  I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didnt get involved in deviant sexual behaviour. Certainly  people who received tainted blood are not to blame. But it just goes to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few.Yes  sin can have terrible consequences  but we need to be  real careful when saying that the consequences are a  punishment  for sin.  The Jews of Jesuss time believed that all sickness was theresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man wasblind to show the glory of God  not because of sin.  If AIDS  or anyother STD is a  punishment  for sexual sin  what do we do with diseases like cancer  or multiple sclerosis  which are just asdebilitating and terrible as AIDS  yet are not usually linked to aspecific behavior or lifestyle   In addition  IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS   I dont know.Atonement is  extremely  important  but I think youve missed the markabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST   period.  This is the centralmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for  all  ofour sins  past present and future.  God does not require pennance forour sins  nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  Hehas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spittingon the sacrifice that Jesus made.In case you couldnt tell  I get  extremely  angry and upset whenI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears andphobias  we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and othersocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease throughtheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ no more and no less than we do.  Ive said this before  but I thinkits a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern day lepers.  Jesushealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS  maybe not onthis earth  but in an ultimate sense.  My next door neighbor has AIDS.She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with God.  Her theology isnt what I would want it to be but Gods grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gainingweight  shes had the disease for over 2 years  and her health isexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributesher improvement in her health to Gods intervention in her life.  Whoare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment   Itseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.Paul Overstreet  the country singer  has a good song title that I think applies to all of us   But for the Grace of God  There Go I or something like that .May we all experience and accept Gods grace.

Revelations,Organization  Indiana UniversityLines  34He doesnt contradict himself.  The church is to last for all time.However  there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  Thisis evident in many letters.  For instance  Paul talks about the super apostles  to the Corinthians  2 Corinthians 11 12   he mentionshow people will be led away by miracles  signs  and wonders  2Thessalonians 2 9 12   he tells Timothy that it is clear that some willabandon the faith and teach lies  1 Timothy 4 1 3  and that some willsearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear  2 Timothy 4 3 4 .Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them Matthew 24 4 14 .  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse14    And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole worldas a testimony to all nations  and then the end will come.   Even today there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiarwith   the non need of baptism and the  praying of Jesus into your lifefor salvation .  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have beentaken out of context from some verses  interpreted from others  and justplain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9 23 26 andLuke 14 25 33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28 18 20.  Thechurch Jesus founded  though  is alive and well.  Its not beingpersecuted as much as back then  the laws wont allow it yet   but it isbeing persecuted.Joe Fisher  Peace  Lou                                                                            Lou Nunez    e mail lnunez vaxa.stevens tech.edu                Ps 42 43  4   Ps 90 91  5 6    Dn 3 52 90   Ml 1 11              Ad Altare Dei   Ad Deum Qui Laetificat Juventutem Meam            1Cor 4 15   MT 16 13 19   1Cor 13 1 13   Luke 10 25 37

Gamma Ray Bursters   Where are they  ,Organization  Mankato State UniversityNntp Posting Host  vax1.mankato.msus.eduLines  67In article  1radsr att access.digex.net   prb access.digex.com  Pat  writes     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away     Given the enormous  power   i was just wondering   what if they are  quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges        my own pet theory is that its  Flying saucers  entering  hyperspace        but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they  are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes   i just wondered  if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.    pat          Well  lets see....I took a class on this last fall  and I have nonotes so Ill try to wing it...          Heres how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars pulsars  are formed from high mass stars M star  1.4M sun .  High mass stars live fast and burn hard  takingappoximately 10 5 10 7 years before going nova  or supernova.  In this time they dont live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane  so anyof these  if assumed to be the sources of GRBs  will be in the plane of thegalaxy.          Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from thevarious satellites around the solar system   Pioneer Venus has one  eitherPion. 10 or 11  GINGA  and of course BATSE  and we do distribution tests on ourcatalog.  These tests all  show  that the bursts have an isotropicdistribution evenly spread out in a radial direction   and they show signs ofhomogeneity  i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So  unless we aresampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy  we are sampling the UNIVERSE.Not cool  if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now  Isuppose you are saying   Well  we stil only may be sampling from inside thedisk.   Well  not necessarily.  Remember  we have what is more or less aninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay outto beyond Pluto pioneer 11   so we should be able  with all of our detectors detect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Heres an analogy   You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane fromthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mileaway sees the same plane  and measures the angle from the zero point of hisarbitrary system  which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst  and maybefind a source.  To my knowledge  no one has been able to do this.          I should throw in why halo  and corona models dont work  also.  As Isaid before  looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts   shorttimescales  high energy  black holes  and pulsars exhibit much of this type ofbehavior.  If this is the case  as I said before  these stars seem to be boundto the disk of the galaxy  especially the most energetic of the these sources.When you look at a simulated model  where the bursts are confined to the disk but you sample out to large distances  say 750 mpc  you should definitely seenot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction  but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before  there is none ofthese characteristics.                  I think thats all of it...if someone needs clarification  or knowssomething that I dont know  by all means correct me.  I had the honor oftaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of thesedifferent distributions  so we pretty much kicked around every possibledistribution there was  and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars black holes  pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   Its a funfield.

I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete withWASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6.BOS  vs BUF   BOS  in 5. The Bs have been playing awesome hockey in the lasttwo weeks.

If not  DET in 6.VAN  vs WIN   WIN in 6.Upset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.There is something gone foul among Linden  Momesso and Bure.WIN in 6.CAL  vs  LA   CAL in 5.Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL doesnot watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.CAL in 4.2nd round            PITT vs WASH  PITT in 4. It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Theirsaving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.However  if PIGS have a quick first round  they may be a littletoo high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that I will say PITT in 6.BOS  vs MON   BOS  in 6.MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with theBs.  Bs in 6.CHI  vs DET   CHI  in 7.Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machineof late.  Theyve had a non busy end of the season in which they playedlike killers.  DET in 6.WIN  vs CAL   CAL  in 5.CAL has a solid team  a little weak in the nets.  CAL will outmuscle WIN.  CAL in 5.3rd round            PITT vs BOS   PITT in 5. I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take overand give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There maybe something to this   if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7.CHI  vs CAL   CHI  in 5. Finals       PITT vs CHI  PITT in 5. NO  no  no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I dont know what to sayhere.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.

I go to school in Virginia so I cant listen when there are on during the day.  Just wondering.The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station  but doesnt come close tothe ULTIMATE in Sports Radio  610 WIP in Philadelphia.  The signalmight not be as powerful  but then again only stations in New Yorkfeel  obligated  to pollute everyone elses airwaves with a bunch ofhoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day.  WIP took two of yourbest sports jockeys too  Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks.  610WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5 30 AM till midnight  check itout anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia.  If Im notmistaken  WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation  Robp.s the only nice thing about the FAN is that they talk sports allnight.  hopefully 610 will begin to do that somewhat soon

The real question is who what  started the    War. Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab    land     	Huh   A war was started when several armies invaded Israel   vowing to drive the Jews into the sea.  Most Jews wanted to live in  peace  and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship.  I am surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by the Jews from arabs  for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state  as a hostile action leading to war.	It was for the purpose of establishing a state  not anexclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive  it would not have400 000 arab citizens.	And no  I do not consider the purchase of land a hostileaction.  When someone wants to buy land  and someone else is willingto sell it  at a mutually agreeable price  then that is commerce.  Itis not a hostile action leading to war. As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace  maybe. However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish state  where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of the land.  Living in peace is meaningless unless it means living  WITH  someone else  as equal. For a native arab  this  does not leave many options.	Oh  you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens   Thearabs who stayed are now citizens  with as much right to choose whothey vote for as the Jews. Those palestinians who stayed  actually stayed despite of what  happened  and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority. If I were wrong  youd have Israel recall all the palestinian refugees  were talking millions . After all  they are civilians. 	Huh   The people who left  did so voluntarily.  There is noreason for Israel to let them in. Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade  to keep the western aid flowing .	Israel got no western aid in 1948  nor in 1949 or 50...Itstill granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And howis granting citizenship a facade   	Tell me something  Sam.  What makes land  arab   How shall I explain  Its a contract between the man and the land.  Control isnt it. The Ottomans ruled 400 years  and then left with barely a trace.  The concept of Land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic West.  It is partly the concept of le sol natal  native soil.  I know that jews had previous history in the region  but none in recent memory.  Im talking everyday life not archeology.	Try again  you tell me what its isnt  but you fail toestablish what it is.	Also  Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousandyears.

My   basis of morality is not on societal norms  or on current legalities.  My  basis is  surprise surprise  on both the Bible and on inherent moral  abhorrences       AH  But what  exactly  is  inherently abhorrent  and WHY is it so What youre saying is  in effect   I think some things are repulsive and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me  so theyshould be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever  period .      Which in and of itself is nice enough  to some extent I agree withyou. But I do _not_ agree that things are inherently or absolutelyimmoral  they are labeled immoral each for its own good reason  and ifthe reason can even theoretically change  then so can the label. ...   Yes  thats vague  and the only way I know off the top of my head to  defend it is to say that all humans are similarly made. Yes  that falls  into the trap of creation       No it doesnt. Humans are to some extent similar  because we allbelong to the same species  that that species has evolved is anotherstory altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credenceto moral absolutism  of a flavour . ...   My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust  goodness    love  respect  courage  and honesty in any society rather than deceipt   hatred  disrespect   cowardness   and dishonesty.      Youre saying morality is whatll keep society alive and kicking.It is  I think  up to a point  but societies are not all alike  andneither are their moralities.  No  I havent been everywhere and   seen everyone  but  according to my thesis  I dont have to  since I hold that  we were all created similarly.      Similar    identical.

Smith writes         but I still want to know why it intrinsically better        than IDE  on an ISA bus  when it comes to multi tasking OSs when       managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.          A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data     from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data     and moves it to memory.      IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA     and most A D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal  and has nothing to    do directly with SCSI.IDE does not do DMA.  This is because its like te PC AT hard diskinterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on thecontroller card  then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to mainmemory where its needed.  If IDE doesnt work this way  then its notcompatible.Heck  if IDE used DMA  then youd hear all kinds of complaints aboutISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDEdrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus  and if IDEdid DMA there would be trouble. BTW  there are DMA enabling signals in the IDE cable spec  but thelast report I heard was that they are never implemented  because itwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.

This has beenan ellusive matter for researchers  and is one of the fundamental requirementsfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.Up to now  only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to  prove  thatthe disease exists.This paper is noteworthy in two other regards 1  None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogshad episodes of lameness during a 6 8 week period which occurred 2 5months after exposure.  After this period  none showed any furtherclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  Sothese are proven  clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneousrecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course  observationslonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesnthave the same chronicity that some see in humans.2   The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by thevaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course  they wantthe world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccineefficacy.Anyway  maybe we will see some independent  scientifically sound evaluationsof this vaccine in the next year or so.

Hypercard for UNIX,Nntp Posting Host  teal.csn.orgOrganization  Colorado SuperNet  Inc.Lines  35queloz bernina.ethz.ch  Ronald Queloz  writes  Hi netlanders  Does anybody know if there is something like Macintosh Hypercard for any UNIX  platform There are several products you might investigate.  If youve got 20 000 per seat and high end hardware  Gain Momentum might be a goodchoice.  It isnt compatible with HyperCard  but has a similararchitecture  and  way  more functionality .  I dont have contactinformation  but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldntbe too hard to find.If youre running News on SPARC  check out HyperLook hyperlook turing.com .  It uses Postscript as a scripting languagewhich is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting but not so good for non programmers.  It was  995  last I heard.You might also look at our product MetaCard.  Were alpha testingdirect importing of HyperCard stacks  weve even made the test releaseavailable for anonymous FTP   so were obviously the closest infunctionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs 495.  Email to info metacard.com for more details.

THE DIVINE MASTERS,Organization  University of Wisconsin Eau ClaireLines  208                                       THE DIVINE MASTERS                            Most Christians would agree  and correctly so  that           Jesus Christ was a Divine Master  and a projection of God           into the physical world  God Incarnate.                          But there are some very important related facts that           Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of  as are followers of           most other world religions.                           First  Jesus Christ was NOT unique  John 3 16 NOTWITH           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            God Incarnate  PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY  both before and           after the life of Jesus.                    The followers of some of these Masters founded the           worlds major religions  usually PERVERTING the teachings of           their Master in the process.  Christians  for example  added           THREATS of  ETERNAL DAMNATION  in Hell  and DELETED the           teaching of REincarnation.                       Secondly  and more importantly  after a particular           Master physically dies and leaves this world  there is           NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively           few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY           alive.   THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE           UNIVERSES.                                             Therefore  all those Christians who worship Jesus  and           pray to Jesus  and expect Jesus to return and save them from           their sins  are only KIDDING THEMSELVES  and have allowed           themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly           MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                      And emotional  feelings  are a TOTALLY DECEIVING           indicator for religious validity.                    These things are similarly true for followers of most           other major world religions  including Islam.                     Thirdly  the primary function of each Master is to tune           His Initiates into the  AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM  or  SOUND           CURRENT    referred to as  THE WORD  in John 1 1 5  and as            The River of Life  in Revelation 22 1   and to personally           guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they           are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            silver cord .                    True Salvation  which completes a Souls cycles of           REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes  is achieved           only by reaching at least the  SOUL PLANE   which is five           levels or universes above the physical universe  and this           canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY Living Divine           Master.                    One such Divine Master alive today is an American  Sri           Harold Klemp  the Living  Eck  Master or  Mahanta  for the            Eckankar  organization  now headquartered in Minneapolis             P.O. Box 27300   zip 55427 .                    Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji  now           living in Punjab  India  and is associated with the  Sant           Mat  organization.                      One of the classic books on this subject is  THE PATH OF           THE MASTERS   Radha Soami Books  P.O. Box 242  Gardena  CA            90247   written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson  a theologian           and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India           studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of           that time  Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                    Several of the Eckankar books  including some authored           by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp  can be found in           most public and university libraries and some book stores  or           obtained thru inter library loan.  The book  ECKANKAR  THE           KEY TO SECRET WORLDS   by Sri Paul Twitchell  is ANOTHER           classic.                    Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with           the  Anti Christ   which is or was to be a temporary world           dictator during the so called  last days .  But the Masters           dont ever rule  even when asked or expected to do so as           Jesus was.                    People who continue following Christianity  Islam  or           other orthodox religions with a physically DEAD Master  will           CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation  between the           Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world  until they           finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY LIVING Divine           Master.                             RE INCARNATION                         The book  HERE AND HEREAFTER   by Ruth Montgomery            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation           as a FACT OF LIFE  including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past           lives  about 50  accurate  the subconscious mind sometimes           makes things up  especially with a bad hypnotist             SPONTANEOUS RECALL  especially by young children  some of           whom can identify their most recent previous relatives            homes  possessions  etc.   DREAM RECALL of past life experi           ences  DEJA VU  familiarity with a far off land while travel           ing there for the first time on vacation   the psychic read           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE  and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS           FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17 11 13  John the           Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.  and John 9 1 2  How           can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born  unless he LIVED           BEFORE   .    ALWAYS use the  KING JAMES VERSION .  Later           versions are PER VERSIONS                             Strong INTERESTS  innate TALENTS  strong PHOBIAS  etc.            typically originate from a persons PAST LIVES.  For example            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually           results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.            And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to           another person being met for the first time in THIS life            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS           INCARNATION.                The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF           KARMA  Galatians 6 7  Revelation 13 10  etc. .  People would           behave much better toward each other if they knew that their           actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the           future  or in a FUTURE INCARNATION             2nd COMINGS                If a Divine Master physically dies   translates             before a particular Initiate of His does  then when that           Initiate physically dies   translates    the Master will meet           him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul           Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd           Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience  NOT something that           happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still           waiting for Jesus  2nd Coming  are WAITING IN VAIN.                                   PLANES OF EXISTENCE               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN           major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the           Astral Plane  the Causal Plane  the Mental Plane  the Etheric           Plane  often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane             the Soul Plane  and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The           Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN   counting upward from           the Physical .  The planes between  but NOT including  the           Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                    It is likely that ESP  telepathy  astrological           influences  radionic effects  biological transmutations  See           the 1972 book with that title.   and other phenomena without           an apparent physical origin  result from INTERACTIONS between           the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                    The major planes are also SUB DIVIDED.  For example  a           sub plane of the Astral Plane is called  Hades   and the           Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it  created there           LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some           kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a           THREATENING manner.  The Christian  Heaven  is located           elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there           for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                         SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH               The Christian religion demands of its followers an           extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more           than GOOD FEELING  which is TOTALLY DECEIVING .                       If a person is not HEARING some form of the  SOUND           CURRENT    THE WORD    THE BANI    THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM              then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL           CONTINUE.                    The  SOUND CURRENT  manifests differently for different           Initiates  and can sound like a rushing wind  ocean waves on           the sea shore  buzzing bees  higher pitched buzzing sound  a           flute  various heavenly music  or other sounds.  In Eckankar            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as           a Member.  This and other experiences  such as  SOUL TRAVEL             REPLACE blind faith.

Mycomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendorsthat supported OpenGL  rather than deal further with SGI.What I  am  annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe thatwe  would  be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of theCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.Im also annoyed about being sold  several  Personal IRISes at aprevious site on the understanding  that  architecture would be aroundfor a while  rather than being flushed.Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has tokeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line  odd that I found myselfpressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the booksjust before the end of the quarter   but Im just a little tired ofgetting boned in the process.Maybe its because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies  so wearent entitled to a  peek under the covers  as the Big Kids  NASA for instance  are.  This lab  and I suspect that a lot of other labsand organizations  doesnt have a load of money to spend on computersevery year  so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis.The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through theentire grant period of five years and  in some case  beyond.  Thatmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when Ihave the money  not some product that was built  to paraphrase oneprevious posters words  to fill a niche to compete with some othervendor.  Im going to be looking at this box for the next five years.And every time I look at it  Im going to think about SGI and how Icould have better spent my money  actually  your  money  since weresupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars .Now youll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in acorner somewhere and think dark  libelous thoughts.							spl   Steve Lamont  SciViGuy     619  534 7968    spl szechuan.ucsd.eduSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource UC San Diego La Jolla  CA 92093 0608 My other car is a car  too.

Spencer NNTP Posting Host  slc5.ins.cwru.eduIn a previous article  gwm spl1.spl.loral.com  Gary W. Mahan  says   Why should a good driver be terrified at 130mph  The only thing I fear  going at 130 are drivers  who switch to the left lane without using  either rear view mirror or flashers. Doing 130 to 150 aint a rush  for me  but its fun and I get where I want to go much faster.  In defense of the drivers  who are in the right lane.  Here in the states  people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50 mph.  I dont think this is because they are stupid  of course  there are exceptions   they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you  in the states  when you look in the rear view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50  speed differential.   Dont get me wrong  I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake cars who are on the right  I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car  to recognize the speed differential  I would be the stupid one.  just to satiate my curiosity  why would this make you the stupid one   It seemsto me  everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not needto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a littlemore.  If you glance around  you will be able to tell how much faster than youthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely  but well enough to know if you shouldlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about about the other driver being startled  because i myself have been startledby drivers cruising by at around 90 100mph when im doin 55 65.  The problem though  as i saw it  was not their fault for barreling around me  but my faultfor not paying the attention to my task at hand that i should have been.Oddly enough  since the 2nd time happened 2x in around 4 mo. when id had myliscence for around 6 mo   i havent been startled..and ive been passed bycars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is thefact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along withthem  it doesnt happen at all     even on the long trips        adrenalinewill do that to you...ive had bad cop experiences with speeding  so anythingover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared ill get caught      Maybethey should raise the limit  so we can pay better attention.....just curious  and my .otwoDREW

After 2000 years  can we say that Christian Morality is,Reply To  halat pooh.bears  Jim Halat Lines  34In article  1qjd3o nlv horus.ap.mchp.sni.de   frank D012S658.uucp  Frank ODwyer  writes  Firstly  science has its basis in values  not the other way round. So you better explain what objective atoms are  and how we get them from subjective values  before we go any further.Atoms are not objective.  They arent even real.  What scientists callan atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical  observable properties of our surroundings.  Allof which is subjective.  What is objective  though  is the approach a scientist takes in discussing his model and his observations.  Thereis no objective science.  But there is an objective approachwhich is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objectivein this case means a specified  unchanging set of rules thathe and his colleagues use to discuss their science.This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be anobjective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs onmorality.  But there exists no objective morality.Also  science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussionis objective   not the science  not the discussion itself  .Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimesof what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss oursurroundings in a meaningful  consistent way.I think it was Neils Bohr who said  to paraphrase  Science is whatwe can _say_ about the physical world. jim halat

And you dare to say that you    know more about Nazi Germany than most people  maybe including  us         Im sure you learned the history of Nazi Germany AND Austria from   your family.      	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people  names when they disagree with your position. Opposing the  atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies  as anti semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form of  argument in intellectual circles  you need to get out more  often.   Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German   Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance  high   intellect   low   humanity  none  and antisemitism  average . I respect anybody  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel  and or its politics is an antisemite  except he uses antisemitic  vocabulary terminology demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and  its politicians also commits errors  even some of them are corrupt   like politicians in any other country   but they carry a huge burden   to care for the safety of ALL its citizens  and that is really not an  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country  and its  Jewish citizens plus the so called collaborators  arabs that wanted to  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours  of the map. As I said   Israel is not a perfect country  but it is the ONLY democracy in the  whole Middle East and the only country in the world where Jews from  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries  they are living.  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non Jewish  nations and its governments  as soon as there are more or les big  social economical political problems in any country  the first ones  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews  and later the other  minorities of the country.    I dont think the suffering of some Jews during WWII                                             justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any  attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti semetic is  not appreciated.  This is really outrageous  6.000.000 murdered Jews  besides the  thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another  and the rest  of the living ones mourning for all of them   I dont know what you  call a  Civil Libertarian   never heard about them  but I know only  one thing  if all of them think like you do it  then  Civil Libertarians   is a new denomination for Antisemites. May other Civil Libertarians come  to word to this group so that we can learn if A.Beyer and me are right   that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites   or that Im wrong and he is  missusing that word.

Because the power play is also one aspect     of play  There is still something to be done with these player evaluation    tools      IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man  advantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated  because their point totals are inflated by power play points.      tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull   John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.

Guns for Space,Keywords  Sopa Gun  Space LauncerOrganization  Boeing AI Center  Huntsville  ALLines  22In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solidrockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data ona reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solidmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example  the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percentAluminum.  The technique is to use a foamed aluminum structure.The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles  an I suspectsome bubbling process is used to form it .  In other words  if you madea bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum  then froze it  this is whatyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires inall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated intothe voids  and you get aluminum reinforced solid propellant.  Thefoamed aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The majorimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking  which is theprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.Dani Eder   Dani Eder Meridian Investment Company  205 464 2697 w  232 7467 h  Rt.1  Box 188 2  Athens AL 35611 Location  34deg 37 N 86deg 43 W  100m alt.

It does seem stupid to  drop a mission like Magellan  because there isnt  70 million a year to keep up the mission.  Youd think  that ongoing science  could justify the money.  JPL gets accused of spending more then neccessary  probably some validity in that   but NASA  does put money into some things  that really are Porcine.  Oh well.I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missionswere going to be funded.  I dont remember his name or title off handand I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case  he was asked about that very matter   Why cant we spend a few million moreto keep instruments that we already have in place going  His responce was that there are only so many   available to him andthe lead time on an instrument like a COBE  Magellan  Hubble  etcis 5 10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on usingcurrent instruments in the current budget enviroment he would havevery little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that  surein the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular however starting a few years after he had retired he would becomeone of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for notfunding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Justas he had benefited from his predicessors funding choices  he owed itto whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing newmissions  even at the expense of cutting off some instruments beforethe last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.

He did not  get killed   he killed himself.Once again  wheres your proof  Suicide is considered a sin by BranchDavidians.  Also  Koresh said over and over again that he was not going tocommit suicide.  Furthermore  all the cult experts said that he was notsuicidal.  David Thibedeau  sp    one of the cult members  said that the firewas started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilitiesknocked over a lantern.   The evil was inside the compound.  Evidence please   All that  thou shalt not kill  stuff.Id like to point out that the Bible says  Do not commit murder.  The NKJtranslation mistranslates.  Self defense was never considered murder.  Thereason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid thegovernment would try something.  Their fears were obviously well founded.

I kid you not.This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbinglayers... a hard outer shell and a closed cell foam impact layer.Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner linercompacts over time  long before the outer shell is damaged ordelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many yearsfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can loseup to 80  of its effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I havea video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors  sissy bars  andother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when thecomfort liner is unaffected  dents and holes in the foam can seriouslydegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of parking your lid  on the mirrors  I suggest you look under thecomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantlydamaged  or missing      replace the helmet.  Jerry Lotto  lotto lhasa.harvard.edu          MSFCI  HOGSSC  BCSO  AMA  DoD  18Chemistry Dept.  Harvard Univ.

Question from an agnostic,Organization  Pegasus   HonoluluLines  18Hi Damon   No matter what system or explanation of creation you wishto accept  you always have to start with one of two premises  creationfrom nothing  or creation from something.  There are no otheralternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those twopremises  then again there are two alternatives  either creation wasrandom  or was according to some plan.   If it was random  I am unable to accept that the complex nature ofour world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creaturescould exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under thecontrol of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I callthat intelligence God.   I also prefer the  Creatio ex nihilo  rather than from chaos  as itis cleaner.   There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are andwe must have come from somewhere.

If a murderer is going to be punished  peoplethat think that he should  get what he deserves.   Most people wouldntthink it would be fair for the murderer to live  while his victim died. Revenge   Petty and pathetic.Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic  but your views are in theminority. We have a local televised hot topic talk show that very recently did a segment on capital punishment.

True human compassion  forgiveness  and sympathy.Where are we required to have compassion  forgiveness  and sympathy   Ifsomeone wrongs me  I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantageis removed  or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone killsanother  then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept Or  are you stating that human life is sacred  somehow  and that it shouldnever be violated   This would sound like some sort of religious view.   I mean  how reasonable is imprisonment  really  when you think about it   Sure  the person could be released if found innocent  but you still  cant undo the imiprisonment that was served.  Perhaps we shouldnt  imprision people if we could watch them closely instead.  The cost would  probably be similar  especially if we just implanted some sort of  electronic device. Would you rather be alive in prison or dead in the chair   Once a criminal has committed a murder  his desires are irrelevant.And  you still have not answered my question.  If you are concerned aboutthe death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why isnt this same concern shared with imprisonment.

Radar detector DETECTORS ,Organization  Netcom Online Communications Services  408 241 9760 login  guest Lines  25nhowland matt.ksu.ksu.edu  Neal Patrick Howland  writes   From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.   Unfortunately  youre wrong on both counts.  The most common method ofimplementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  Thelocal oscillators frequency can be radiated out of the receiver viathe antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with greatcare.For a reference on detecting radios  get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their localoscillator emissions back in the  1950s  while he worked for BritishIntelligence.

Help with ultra long timing,Organization  Lehigh UniversityLines  49In article  1993Apr5.083324.48826 kuhub.cc.ukans.edu   wellison kuhub.cc.ukans.edu writes  I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design. What I am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer. What they want to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six weeks. Every two weeks  they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the snow. Then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color pellets.  The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold   40 degrees  and a power source that wouldnt drain. I have looked at the XR 2204 timers and the standard NE556 dual timers  but thier temp specs wont go that low. Also  two weeks equates to 1 209 600 seconds per firing  which means one big timing cap   I have found 2.2 farad  yes  Farad    caps that have a working voltage of 5 volts and are small in size. But again  the time of discharge at  40 or lower degrees isnt linear. I was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period  but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain. One possibility would be to use solar panels  but this is during the six month twilight. Anyone have any good ideas    Thanks in advance...       Wes      just a suggestion take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or tensecs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clockinput and decode output for 1 209 600 sec output  might have to add a few andgates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the521 to restartcycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge  the one shot thengoes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..these ckts require uAmps of current between 5   15 volts  so a 12 voltgel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.Then take the ckt board   battery wrap in 3  or 4  of foam or build a boxof out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...build a small heater out of 10 50 Watt resistors in series to keep the batteryand ckts warm.2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.Insolate insolate.......even though the chips state that the   ALrated devices are good to  55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reductionin capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..hope this helpsRW       is this to long winded for the net    be gentle ...

Lets do it right thistime   Lets step back and consider the functionality we want  1  microgravity vacuum process research 2  life sciences research  adaptation to space  3  spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach  explified by Shuttle and SSF so far  was tocentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meettheir targets by a wide margin  the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it  and SSF has crumbled into disorganizationand miscommunication.  Over  50 billion has been spent on thesetwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvementin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile  military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development  the constellation.  Firstly  different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the GPS Navstar constellation in 12 hour orbits comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits  etc.  Secondly  the taskis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.SSFs 3 main functions require quite different environmentsand are also prime candidates for constellization. 1  We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now COMET and Mir for long duration flights  Shuttle Spacelab forshort duration flights.  The best strategy for this area isinexpensive  incremental improvement  installation of U.S. facilities on Mir  Shuttle Mir linkup  and transition from Shuttle Spacelabto a much less expensive SSTO Spacehab COMET or SSTO SIF COMET.We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments  eg the high radiation Van Allen belt or gas plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system canbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks  where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO. 2  We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity but also in lunar and Martian gravities  and in the radiationenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelterof LEO.  This is a very long term  low priority project  sinceastronauts will have little practical use in the space programuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore  usingastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat  a constellationtether bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravityin super Van Allen Belt orbits that are representative of theradiation environment encountered on Earth Moon  Earth Mars Earth asteroid  etc. trips.  The miniaturized life supportmachinery might be operated real time from earth thru a VRinterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown follow ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface testing out the actual environment at low cost before  billionsare spent on astronauts. 3  By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperatedrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers canpractice their skills.  Once in place  robots can pry stucksolar arrays and antennas  attach solar battery power packs inject fuel  etc.  Once the fleet is working  it can bespun off to commercial company s  who can work with the comsatcompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.By applying the successful constellation strategy  and gettingrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF  wehave radically improved the capability of the program whilegreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSFs pricetag we can fix satellites where the satellites are  we can studylifes adaptation to a much large   more representative variety of space environments  and we can do microgravity and vacuumresearch inexpensively and  if needed  in special purposeorbits.N.B.  we can apply the constellation strategy to space explorationas well  greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this  more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be usedto fuel planet wide rover ballistic hopper prospecting andsample return.

Why isnt this information in the FAQ on marijuana      If we expect people to think we are telling them the truth about drugs  why does this group constantly refute every negative thing about almost all drugs.     Maybe because the claims deserve refute   The above abstract lists variouspossible links to cannabis use  unfiltered almost guaranteed  and lungproblems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article  but without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered their data it really doesnt tell you shit.  Im going to track down thatstudy hopefully tomarrow. ...  I never claimed pot was more or less damageing than cigarettes......I was just trying to keep ourselves honest.   If we are going to educate kids...and adults...and tell them the truth about drugs dont you think a much better approach would be to list the pros and cons of each type of drug.   What justifies _the_ truth about drugs   Research   What sort of research   Correlational data can help establish a theory  but it does notprove anything. How can you expect someone to make a decision when the PDFA on one hand says that all drugs are absolutely BAD BAD BAD.....and this newsgroup consistently refuses to admit that drugs like heroin even have negative side effects.    Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administrationand shit like adulterants.  There are side effects  like withdrawal  but theyeffect people differently.   Ive seen numerous posts claiming heroin has lower addiction rates that cigarettes  which might be true  but it is very deceiving  because heroin is much more harmful drug to be addicted to than cigarettes.   Heroin addicts are far more prone to end up in the gutter and destroy their family and friends than people addicted to just cigarettes.    Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that function just fine in society.   This group does provide some very good information to people  but I am worried that the pro legalization pro decriminalization movement is being hurt when it refuses to admit that any some drugs are VERY harmful....Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically. ...        Im all for legalization of most drugs  but when someone asks me about relative risks of certain drugs or possible bad side effects  I would like to know them....and not be given the run around by this group....which recently tried to tell me that pot was not harmful in any manner to peoples lungs.     NO  NO  NO.   or at least I havent been arguing this .  there is not enoughdata to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesnt_ mean that cannabisis benign to users lungs.  we can form all the theories we want  but theyare only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others and that makes them stronger.   I think its time yall re examined your positions and try to understand that you cannot fight the PDFA by calling them a bunch of liars....the hell I cant   they state  UN JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS   AS FACT  asa  POLITICAL  strategy to stop drug use. ... In general  I somewhat see what youre saying.  And people like Jack Herercontribute to this.

Ancient islamic rituals,"Organization  Monash University  Melb.  Australia.Lines  72In  1pkqe2INN54n lynx.unm.edu  cfaehl vesta.unm.edu  Chris Faehl  writes  In article  1993Apr3.081052.11292 monu6.cc.monash.edu.au   darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au  Fred Rice  writes   deleted  to get to the point        Therefore  in a nutshell  my opinion is that pre marital sex makes the   likelihood of extra marital sex more probable.  Furthermore    in my opinion  extra marital sex helps break down partnerships and leads   to greater divorce rates.  This in turn  in my opinion  creates trauma   and a less stable environment for children  who are then  in my opinion    more likely to grow up with psychological problems such as depression    etc.  And thus  sex outside of marriage is  in the long run  harmful to   society. I think that you are drawing links where there are none   having sex before marriage has nothing to do with adultery once committed into marriage. The issue as I see it is more of how committed you are to not foisting pain on your spouse  and how confident you are about yourself.  	In addition  what someone does within their marriage is their own  business  not mine  and not yours. I have witnessed strong relationships that incorporate extra marital sex.  	I would agree with your assertion about children   children should not  be witness to such confusing relationships   if adultery is stressful to  adults  which I assume it in general is  how can we expect children to  understand it       Where is the evidence for my opinions   At the moment  there are just   generalities I can cite.  For example  I read that in the 20th century    the percentage of youth  and people in general  who suffer from   depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies  probably   what I was reading referred particularly to the USA .  Similarly  one   can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage   in this century in Western societies    particularly with the  sexual   revolution  of the 60s  but even before that I think  otherwise the    sexual revolution  of the 60s would not have been possible     particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently   Christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage.  I propose   that these two trends    greater level of general depression in society    and other psychological problems  and greater sexual promiscuity    are   linked  with the latter being a prime cause of the former.  I cannot   provide any evidence beyond this at this stage  but the whole thesis   seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it. Why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards depression  You cant just pick your two favorite trends  notice a correlation  in them  and make a sweeping statement of generality. I mean  you CAN  and  people HAVE  but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis.  At best its a gross oversimplification of the push pull factors people  experience.  My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argumentagainst extra marital sex    one which I personally believe has sometruth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a_plausible_ argument can be made against extra marital sex.  At thisstage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven oranything like that  just that it is plausible.  To try to convince youall of this particular point of view  I would probably have to do a lotof work researching what has been done in this field  etc.  in order togather further evidence  which I simply do not have time to do now.  Also note that I said that I think extra marital sex is  a prime cause  in my opinion  of the generally greater levels of psychologicalproblems  especially depression  in Western societies.  I am not sayingit is  the prime cause  or  the only cause   just  a prime cause    i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think whenyou say you think my view is simplistic  you have forgotten this    Iadmit that there are probably other factors  but I do think thatextra marital sex  and  IMO  subsequent destabilization of the family is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems likedepression in Western society this century.

Building a brute force machine to test 2 40 possible keysif you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.   One chip one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks  and thatbreak gives you all messages involving that phone.    The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives younothing is an improvement  but notice that XORing with  truely random bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using  for XOR  SK for the escrowed key  and A and B for two random bitstrings  hand SK A B  SK A  and SK B to three escrow agents.  It ispossible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern for example 3 of 4  such that fewer cooperating escrow agents givesthe cracking agency no benefit.  					Robert I.

I will oblige.My name is Elias Davidsson  Icelandic citizen  born in Palestine. Mymother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the undesirables at that times this group was defined as Jews . She was forced to goto Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled inIceland  30 years ago  and met many people who were thrown out frommy homeland  Palestine  because of the same reason  they belonged tothe indesirables . These people include my neighbors in Jerusalemwith the children of whom I played as child. Their crime  Theyarenot Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice  period. Mywork for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racismand racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practicesin Arab countries have my support   as long as their protest is basedon a principled position  but not as a tactic to deflect criticismfrom Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activitiesundertaken under my guidance in different domains  and which commandthe support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formalinstitution and works with minimal funds.Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.I would hope that discussion about Israel Palestine be conducted ina more civilized manner.

A friend of mine and I saw  and heard  a Viper   and my friends first response was that it sounded like a truck   It sounded  fine to me  but then again  I dont like the whiny noise that most modern  sports car engines make.  BTW  the Viper we saw was moving at about 10mph   just like all of the other cars on the 10 freeway heading east out of LA  on a Friday afternoon.  Looked really nice  though. 	Actually  I was under the impression that the V 10 in the Viper was NOT the V 10 that Dodge was developing for its new Kenworths.  I have always thought it was the exhaust system and not the engine that produced the noise of a car... Well  yes  the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out  but thebasics  tone  firing cadence  etc.  are determined by the engine configuration.In the case of the Viper  yes  we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90 deg.engine  which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding  btw  isthat that V 10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad aptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what Ive heard  no firsthand knowledge       its doing a pretty good job at both.And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60 degreeDOHC Colombo designed V 12.

Providing technical assistance to Iran to get its oil  production back up to capacity would also be a smart move  at the moment   Iran is above its OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would  use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.I agree with most of what Phill says  except the point about it being inour interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S.and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany Japan and many other  industrial rivals  more than these two.  In addition  the proceeds from the sale  especially by Saudi Arabia  KuwaitU.A.E. etc  are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B.  propping up these economies and further providing an incentive to keep prices from falling too low.Dan Epstein

They allow switching between two  serial devices on a single port.Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so aswitch isnt going to help them.

Question about Virgin Mary,Organization  Freshman  Civil Engineering  Carnegie Mellon  Pittsburgh  PALines  28 As the moderator noted  I think you mean the Assumption.  Catholics believe that the Blessed Virgin Mary went to Heaven body  and  soul at the end of her life.  This is unusual because the normal course of events is for your body to decay in the grave and stay that way until the Resurrection of the Dead.Well  it wasnt that way for Enoch and Elijah  both of whom weretranslated directly into heaven.  Its beyond my grasp why some objectthat Mary  who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah  should notbenefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all Mother of God  full of grace  and immaculate. Historically  belief in the Assumption can be found in the writings of St. Gregory of Tours  late 6th century .And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus  and inSt. Andrew of Crete  among others.And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syriaalso hold to this belief as part of divine revelation  even though theybroke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting theCouncil of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that theCatholics and Orthodox made this belief up  but the Monophysites  put abig hole in that notion  as they also hold the belief  and they splitfrom the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing  asfar as is known  much has been lost from the time of the Fathers .Andy Byler

Hard disk question,Organization  Interactive Systems Corp.  Boulder COLines  24In article  Aovai.0bp4 qube.OCUnix.On.Ca  Aovai qube.OCUnix.On.Ca  Aovai  writes  Hi   I just disassembled my old XT and get 2 disk drives   30M hard drive and a  360K floppy drive.  My questions are     can I use these 2 drives as drives D   E on my 386SX25    This 386SX25   currently has 80M hard drive  1.2M   1.44M floppy drives.    if I can  what s w or h w do I need   I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drivesusually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. Thetwo are not compatible on the same controller. However  you might beable to use the drive  with its controller  in your 386SX. You should beable to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller  Ithink . You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in theXT.

Watch out for    folks standing NEXT to the road or on overpasses.   They can    cause SERIOUS HARM to you and your car.          just a cliff notes version of my story follows        10pm last night  I was travelling on the interstate here in    knoxville   I was taking an offramp exit to another interstate    and my wife suddenly screamed and something LARGE hit the side    of my truck.  We slowed down  but after looking back to see the    vandals standing there  we drove on to the police station.       She did get a good look at the guy and saw him  cock his arm  with    something the size of a cinderblock  BUT I never saw him. We are     VERY lucky the truck sits up high on the road  if it would have hit    her window  it would have killed her.        The police are looking for the guy  but in all likelyhood he is gone.        I am a very good driver  knock on wood   but it was night time and    I never saw the guy.  The police said they thought the motive was to    hit the car  have us STOP to check out the damage  and then JUMP US     and take the truck.         PLEASE BE AWARE OF FOLKS.  AND FOR YOUR OWN GOOD  PLEASE DONT STOP           peace.                                                                                                 brian larose  larose cs.utk.edu    12  3103 Essary Rd. Knoxville  TN 37918.               As long as were on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others   were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5   north of Seattle  WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our   windshield. Not by accident Im sure  it was impossible to get up to the   overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids  reported it and   left.   A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was   in his mid fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was   a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old   that did it. They put a cover over the overpass  what else could they do    I dont think Ill over forget this story.In Des Moines  Iowa  about a year ago  some kid dropped a rock from an overpass and hit car just behind the windshield.  It put a dent in the roof  so I guess I was lucky it hit metal.Its frustrating that we cant do much.  Bother the city government to putcovers on all overpasses   Slow down speed up a bit when driving under alloverpasses in the city   I like the first better  but that will take timeand lots of people talking to the city governments.Just another .02...

Now  the Genocide of the Azeri Turks of x Soviet Armenia and Karabag ,Reply To  sera zuma.UUCP  Serdar Argic Distribution  worldLines  69In article  1993Apr20.164517.20876 kpc.com  henrik quayle.kpc.com writes  At last  I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH  crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again.Do you have a terminal cold  Karabag is Turkish and will remain Turkish. Here we are  almost at the end of the 20th century  and a whole community  the Azeri Turks of x Soviet Armenia and Karabag  is facing forced assimilation  torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus  expulsion and genocide on the other  all because of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself  is the world community really so powerless  Where are all those human rights advocates  Where are all the decent people  Are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it  The numberof Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savagegangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truthand on the other  they beg mercy from Turkiye.        The Age...Melbourne...6 3 92        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam  Azerbaijan  Thursday        The exact number of victims is still unclear   but there can be         little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian         fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno Karabakh last week.         Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly   sheltering in  the         Azeri border town of Agdam  give largely consistent accounts of         how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25         February     chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the         surrounding forests. Yesterday  I saw 75  freshly dug graves in         one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were         shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I         also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift         hospital in a string of railway carriages.         Khojaly  an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by         Armenians   had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov         Commander of Police in Agdam   said  only about 500  escaped to         his  town.     So where are the rest  .  Some might have  taken         prisoner  he said  or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the         mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to         retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished  some of         cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.         One  refugee   Rami Nasiru   described how Khojaly residents at         first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting         to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.         But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored         personnel carriers  they realised they could not hope to defend         themselves  with  machineguns and grenades   and fled into  the         forests. In the small hours  the massacre started.         Mr.  Nasiru   who believes his wife and two children were taken         prisoner    repeated what many other refugees have said    that         troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack         Khojaly.  It is not my opinion  I saw it with my own eyes.  Serdar Argic                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.                                                   Ohanus Appressian   1919                            In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.  Sahak Melkonian   1920

Is there ANY security in the Clipper ,"Organization  CMC Network Systems  Rockwell DCD   Santa Barbara  CA  USALines  35In article  ZEEV.93Apr18014822 sepia.ccc.amdahl.com  zeev ccc.amdahl.com  Zeev Wurman  writes  It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost  irrelevant   if I cannot choose the key  but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry  the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good  or as bad  as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.  or their handlers. It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER  MANUFACTURED   after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that will ever be manufactured. The key depositories can be as secure and incorruptible as they wish to be  nobody cares anyway...   They key depositories are IRRELEVANT. In order for the applicable lawenformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request fromescrow  the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear textas part of the link establishment protocol. Whoever owns the program that assigns keys to each serial number wont need access to the keydepository.In other words  the FBI may need a court ordered release of escrowedkeys  but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured.There is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys. Whilerelations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained there is also a long history of trading favors. This will re establishthe NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without courtorders.The more I think about this affair  the fouler it smells.

Do we need the clipper for cheap security ,"Organization  Harvey Mudd College  Claremont  CA 91711Lines  56In article  1r466c an3 news.intercon.com  amanda intercon.com  Amanda Walker  writes  Agreed.  Remember  I dont even think of Clipper as encryption in any real  sense  if I did  Id probably be a lot more annoyed about it.I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore  its promotion asproviding greater protection than bare voice is quite true  as faras it goes.  However  the only way for it to fulfill its stated goalof letting LE wiretap  terrorists and drug dealers  is to restrictstronger techniques.  Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption  weak encryption  or the vast majority  no encryption.  The latter two classes can betapped.  With weak encryption in every phone  the no encryptionclass is merged into the weak encryption class.  Will theintroduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strongprivacy to give up on it   that is  to rely for privacy on a systemexpressly designed to deny it to people like them   I doubt it.  Themere introduction of this scheme will give the government  nothing .The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretappingcapabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domesticcryptography  and only by this restriction.   Clipper  appears to beno more than a sop  given to the public to mute any complaints.  Wewould find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff  but I fear the publicat large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control  butmost people seem to think that an  assault weapon  as the NYT usesthe word  is some sort of automatic weapon  .50 caliber maybe.  Whowants to have such a thing legal   Well  people know even less aboutcryptology  I suspect that strong cryptography could easily belabeled  too much secrecy for law abiding citizens to need . Thats not for Clinton  or anyone under him  to say  though.  Only the  federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality. Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at  best.What they say is opinion  but what they do is what matters  and willcontinue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annullaw or regulation  going to some length to decide cases on othergrounds.  Furthermore  Congress can get away with quite a bit.  Theycould levy a burdensome tax  this would place enforcement in thehands of the BATF  who as weve seen you really dont want on yourcase.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause  this seems mostlikely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th wasrequired because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statuteunconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs  with atextual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled SubstancesAct of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get awaywith it. Amanda Walker	 PGP 2 key by finger or e mail   Eli   ebrandt jarthur.claremont.edu"

My Gun is like my American Express Card,"Organization  Iowa State University  Ames IALines  125Thomas Parsli  thomasp ifi.uio.no  writes  	Observations from a naive norwegian Yup  you said it.  I admire such honesty.     	1  Guns are made to KILL people  not to shoot target or to  	have something more macho than stamps to collect.....Fire an Anschutz .22  then come back and talk to us.  Youre lettingignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that  or thisis sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events.Funny  youd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse.     	2  It IS more easy to kill injure someone with a gun than 	with a knife or a bat  as in baseball .Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius  you know  but forsome reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  Toextend this a bit further  you need only a certain level of competenceto beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with aweapon and winning is much more difficult  and requires more trainingtime the average citizen just does not have.  Ive spent a few yearspracticing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one though self defense isnt the reason I own one .  My kid sister wouldhave an even chance of beating me  gun vs. gun  with only a month oftraining.  That makes firearms much better  in our eyes. 	3  Its not very wise to compare two completely different 	countries like USA and  lets say  Island on issues like 	crime and violence.Excellent point.  Perhaps you arent so naive after all  	4  Yes  the problem is  people committing crimes  not the tools 	beeing used  but 1  should be taken into concideration.Taken into consideration in what respect   Though quite wrong  letsmake it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has beentaken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault assault with a deadly weapon  assault with intent to kill  attemptedmurder  and a whole host of others  and tack on extra prison time. 	We have a very strict gun legislation in Norway  but until recently 	it was possible for enyone over 18 years to buy a shotgun. 	Shotguns are used mainly for hunting in Norway ...   but because it 	was so easy to accuire one  it was THE most used gun in crimes.In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conqueredyour land  among others  a full millenia before we were thought of  andshortly thereafter weapons werent quite so common.  I suspect that a fewworld wars made a difference too  since in times of emergency weaponstend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  Im curious  though were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime  orwere they aquired by other means   Any requirements other than justregistering the shotgun  	And  unbelievable  the use of guns in crime fell..... 	There are now a new law against wearing long knives in public  	and why should it be allowed    Come on down to honest Eriks Used Swords   Heres a slightly usedshort sword   THE  battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventhcentury   Only  39.95 with trade in.  Easy financing    Sorry  Icouldnt resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives or is this really not a problem  	What I  as an scandinavian  have problems to understand is that  	you  Americans  have a more liberal view on guns and violence 	than on nudity and sex. 	Try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder...Im all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians  and yes  Im onlya couple generations off the longship  used to be some of the mostfeared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago  yet now seem tospend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.Maybe you had a bit more time  and a more homogeneous culture  to becomecivilized with  	Yes  I know a little American history  but is it a civil human 	right to have an assault gun in your home and or an handgun 	in your car  Yes.  Were too damned violent  partially I believe because we are nota homogeneous culture and dont identify ourselves as  Americans  firstand foremost.  Im rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage whereas I suspect you couldnt care less about that 2  Welsh blood inyour veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055   The time scaleand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is abasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.In America  the individual is more important than the masses.  Personalliberties are prized above all.  This is  sadly  changing of late  butI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrictindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  Idhazard a guess that  were America less interested in freedom andpersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never wouldhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culturewe have is that were looking out for ourselves and it is quite easyto identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmothertells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke low Dane   whereas others spoke  high Dane.   It was shortly afterWorld War II  as I remember  that  low Dane  was abolished so there wasone common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem because we have even more obvious means of identifying an  outsider.

Young Catchers,Organization  University of VirginiaLines  70Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.My opinion  FWIW  to all Mark  age doesnt matter  ability does. I would rather have the untriedrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has provenhimself to be average at best. I dont care if he is 15  if he playsbetter than what I have  I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decentminor league numbers  grossly inflated by the PCL in general and LasVegas in particular  he should have been projected as an average majorleague hitter  which is good for a catcher  Ill admit . Santiagosnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandys  but I dont havethe league data from the mid 80s to check it out.That being said  I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond  at least tostart the season. As the box below shows  he has  one  minor leagueseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very  verypoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhillare not complete mediocrities  for catchers  especially NL catchers they are essentially average hitters  with equivalent averages around.220. If he had hit well at prior levels  I would say he belongs onthe Braves  but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year wasjust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year atany level  at any age  doesnt satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted  I thought his behavior withMcCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first timehe ever got 300 AB in one place  so his lines are hard to read. But hehas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play  with his speed is morevaluable than the OPS alone indicates  and at a still young age  24  had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total  major and minor EQA of .249  above major league average  and above average for CF which was about .240 in the NL last year . He has shown at least thepotential of going into the .290s  which would make him one of the 15best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reachinghis  prime  season of 27.

OB GYN residency,Reply To  geb cs.pitt.edu  Gordon Banks Organization  Univ. of Pittsburgh Computer ScienceLines  30In article  1r12bv 55e terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu  Donald_Mackie med.umich.edu  Donald Mackie  writes   FMGs who are not citizens are  like all aliens  in a difficult situation. Only citizens get to vote here  so non citizens are of little or no interest to legislators. Also  the non citizen may well be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. There is a stron sense that rocking the boat  eg. suing a residency program  will delay the granting of that status  perhaps for ever. One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for trainingare ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In orderto get the green card they have to return to their country andapply at the embassy there.  Of course  many somehow get aroundthis problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a townwith a need and then the congressman from that district tacksa rider onto a bill saying  Dr. X will be allowed to have permanentresidency in the US.   A lot of bills in congress have such ridersattached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common  althoughnow they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell UScitizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines  orwhereever.

The purpose of the conference was topublish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designedto prove that the Republican party would lose major support if itbacked away from the  Family Values  positons of the 92 convention.Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertsons organizationwith political expertise  legal assistance and high tech communicationssupport.The Catholic Campaign for  American  designed as a Catholic versionof the Moral Majority  was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his FreedomCouncil in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.Ms. Elwell was hired by Dominos Pizza magnate  Tom Monaghan  in 1989to manage Legatus  a  nonpolitical   Catholic businessmens group.Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least  4million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contactsat Legatus  Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding theCatholic Campaign.The Campaigns list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.Robert K.

Be it revelatory with interpretation  for prayer use  or for signifying believers  which I doubt since any one can do it . Pentecostals  Assembly of God  Church of Christ   seem to espouse all three.  Neo pentecostals tend to view prayer use and as a sign as the uses.  Speaking in tongues during a service is not usually done by neo pentecostals because for the most part  they still attend Protestant churches.  Non denominational churches seem to view the use as a sign as merely optional  but recommended.Koberg 	Just a couple of minor corrections here...	1   The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking intongues  in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed toPentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God inChrist  the largest African American Pentecostal denomination.	2   Im not sure what you mean by  signifying believers   but itshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now  nor has itever  held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals  including the A G  maintain isthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becominga Christian in which one is  Baptized in the Holy Spirit   That may bewhat you were referring to  but I point this out because Pentecostals arefrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in orderto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not themajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage inMark 16 about  these signs following them that believe  but they generallydo not interpret this as meaning if you dont pactice the signs you arent saved .	3   I know its hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement thathas such diversity  but I think youve made some pretty biggeneralizations here.  Do  Neo Pentecostals  only believe in tongues as asign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message  Ive never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized themas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues asa sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also  while neo Pentecostals may not beinclined to speak in tongues in the non Pentecostal churches they attend they do have their own meetings and  in many cases  a whole church will becharismatic.Ken BannerDept. of Religious StudiesUniversity of Pennsylvaniakbanner philae.sas.upenn.edu "

Anyone have the slightest idea why this should be   Even a clue as to whether  the hardware  battery  CMOS   or DOS is broken I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running themenu all night.  There is a limitation bug in the date roll over software inPCs that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard inputvia a DOS call rather than a BIOS call  as menus often use  otherwise the codeto update the date after midnight never gets called. Somebody might be able to correct the details in case Ive mis rememberredthem  but I think you have to change the menu program  if you have the sources or add a TSR or system patch or something.

B2     Male sex survey  Gay activity low    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior  the most thorough    examination of American mens sexual practices published since    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago  shows about 2    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.The median number of sexual partners for all men 20 39 was 7.3.Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters  Johnson and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners  it is apparent thathomosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the generalmale population.

I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes onin Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda.

Blocks with not more than eight non zerocoefficients use a non separated direct multiply accumulate 2D IDCT sounds great  doesnt it    which turned out to be faster than a fastalgorithm in this  quite common  case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder  except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms  is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors  the  default  option touse a restricted color space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image  I claim  judge yourself .Restricted color space means that the U and V components are clipped to   0.25  instead of    0.5  and the display color space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two  the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color  lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space  is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes  the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC . The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas....  Stefan Eckart  stefan lis.e technik.tu muenchen.de

Watson  writes   In Quebec French  the word for the celebration of the resurrection is   Pa ques   this is etymologically related to Pesach  Passover  and the  pascal lamb.  So is the French Canadian  mostly Roman Catholic  celebration  better because it uses the right name I was at my parents Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the packages was English  Hebrew and French.  In the phrase  kosher for passover  the French word used was  Pa ques.    Weve deliberately mistranslated this at the Kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods being kosher for Easter.    Back to the original questions in this thread concerning Christians of Jewish descent and the Law   I always wonder when I see posts on this subject whether the writers are Christians of Jewish descent relating the life decisions God has led them to or people who take only an academic interest in the topic.   Having known Seanna since she was nine years old  I do know in this case.   I admit that the answer to this question affects the amount of weight I give to the writers statement.Jayne Kulikauskas  jayne mmalt.guild.org

Clipper will corrupt cops  was WH proposal from Police point of view ,Reply To  tuinstra signal.ece.clarkson.edu.soeOrganization  Sun Microsystems  Inc.Lines  93Nntp Posting Host  signal.ece.clarkson.eduIn article 735230663 fbihh  bontchev fbihh.informatik.uni hamburg.de  Vesselin Bontchev  writes  strnlght netcom.com  David Sternlight  writes     dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the   effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police. Actually  reading   between the lines  it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one   respect  since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and   local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally.  Instead of reading between the lines  try to think a little bit. OK  if thats way too difficult to you  here are some hints.  Indeed  the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on the local police  if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie that your mom is telling you on the phone. So  guess what they will do  Propose that the new technology is removed  Or implement some  facilitations   Of course  you wont want to wait until they get the approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation between two child molesters  because meanwhile those two child molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child  right  So  there should be some way for them to get access to those keys  quickly   right  Like  they could have a copy of the database  and worry about a warrant later...I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post  but thatswhat I get from posting at 1 am...The central point I made is that local state police agencies attempting toplay by the rules and get warrants  legit escrowed keys  etc.  may findthemselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infightingat the federal level.  I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboycops.  It would be a strong incentive  as Vesselin points out  for morepolice agencies to  go rogue  and try to get keys through more efficient but less Constitutional  means.  Notice what the release said    Q    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to        decipher the message    A    They would have to obtain legal authorization  normally a                                                                         court order  to do the wiretap in the first place.                   The clear implication is that there are  legal  authorizations otherthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these    And who knows whats in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA  .  Theremay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies  in whichkeys are traded.  Furthermore  the police will be in an excellentposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  Theyalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  Thereare a few laws that I know of  that limit citizens rights to accesspolice communications  or use the information they get .  It may bevery difficult to prove police misuse    the fact that you have suchevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.Throw in private detectives  who have even fewer policy constitutionalrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries whove  retired  from intelligenceagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.Dont think itll happen   Well  consider e.g. the Michigan State Police  generally a very professionalorganization  which for years kept  Red Files  on thousands of suspected commies  knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standardsof evidence were just about zero  people were in the file because theyhappened to park near a place where  say  a US China Peoples Friendshiprally was happening    the police went around writing down licenseplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the meeting place  well  the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on anymore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapesas well. Even with well meaning cops  and Im sure there are many   there will be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We dont needto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers    it will all be in the interest of enforcing sensible laws  saving lives  and protecting property.  Compromises will be made by well meaning officers  facing what  to them  will be a moral dilemma.Clipper will make criminals out of cops.

Frequently Asked Questions,Keywords  Monthly PostingReply To  welty balltown.cma.comOrganization  New York State Institute for Sebastian Cabot StudiesExpires  Thu  20 May 1993 04 03 03 GMTLines  251Archive name  rec autos part4 this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonlyasked automotive questions  the other article contains questionsof general consumer interest  and is broken out to facilitatecrossposting to misc.consumers    rpw  last change  8 February 1993  CT now permits radar detector usage     new tire traction q a    rpw                 Commonly Asked QuestionsRadar Questions Q   Where are radar detectors illegal A   In the US  currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in    large trucks.  In Canada  they are illegal in Manitoba  Ontario     Quebec  Newfoundland and PEI  Prince Edward Island .  They    are apparently are illegal through most  if not all  of Europe.    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other    jurisdictions  chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.Q   Where are Radar Detector Detectors used   Do they really work A   Usage is spreading rapidly  initially they were used only in Canada     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently    available super Het radar detectors  some brands of detector radiate    more strongly than others  and are thus more likely to be spotted.    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned    on.Q   What is VASCAR   Is it some kind of Radar A   VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time speed distance    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR    system.Q   What is Ka band radar   Where is it used   Should a radar detector be    able to handle it  A   Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US    in so called photo radar installations.  In these installations  a    low powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the    direction of traffic  and a picture is taken of vehicles which the    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low    power and the 45 degree angle  many people believe that a radar    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo radar is in use    is limited  and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice     learn what photo radar units look like  and keep track of where they    are used  or else  dont speed. Q   Do radar jammers work   Are they legal A   Quick answer   No  and Not in the USA.    Detailed answer   Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions Q   What are understeer and oversteer A   Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a    car while cornering near the  limit  limit of adhesion  that is.     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put  they    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner  steer  less     or  understeer  or it wants to turn more in a corner   oversteer.     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that    untrained drivers  inadvertantly traveling too fast  wont get into    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance    oriented cars  it may be induced by lifting on the throttle  Trailing    throttle oversteer  or TTO .  In extreme cases  lifting on the throttle    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or    spinning.    Some technical details   in a corner at speed  the tires on the car    will develop what are called  slip angles  the slip angle is the    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to    travel.  In understeer  the front wheels have a greater slip angle    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer  the rear wheels have a greater    slip angle than the front wheels.Q  What is a rev matched downshift A  When downshifting  the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear   than it was in the higher gear.  However  during a downshift  normally   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle  so the revs drop   rather than increase.  In rev matched downshift  you blip the throttle   before re engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.Q  What does heel and toe mean A  Heel and toe is a technique used to do a rev matched downshift while   braking.  This is normally challenging  because you need the right foot   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel and toe because you   use one end of the foot on the brake  and the other on the throttle to   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side   on the throttle.   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch  and just use the   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle  accomplishing   the same thing.Q  What is double clutch downshifting A  While your right foot is doing the above  your left foot can do one of   three things   nothing  declutch once  or declutch twice.  The reason for   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with   rev matching  so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch   engaged  the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission   speed up.   The procedure is as follows     0  declutch    1  move gearshift lever to neutral    2  engage clutch    3  match revs    4  declutch    5  move gearshift lever to next lower gear    6  engage clutch   This sounds like a lot of work  but with practice it becomes natural.   The problem that double clutching solves is normally the function of the   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or   with very worn synchros  double clutching makes it much easier to shift.   Basically  if you double clutch well  you are not using the synchros at   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good   condition.Q  What do the numbers for acceleration from 0 60  1 4 mile  skidpad  and   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean   May they be compared A  In short  1  not as much as the magazines want you to believe  and   2  almost never.   In more detail   the acceleration numbers  0 60mph and 1 4 mile times   in the US  may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine   that comparing a Road   Track number to a Car   Driver number is quite   pointless.  Keep in mind  too  that the same variation applies from   driver to driver on the street  the driver is a major  often  the    major  part of the equation.   Skidpads vary  and even if they didnt  skidpad figures are really   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires  they change radically   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the   comparative handling of  say  two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value  however. Skidpads   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.   Slalom times are slightly more useful  they test some small parts of the   automobiles transient response.  However  they are also heavily influenced   by the stock rubber on the car  and they do not test many corners of the   cars envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making   a buying decision.  For example  they dont tell you what the rear end   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off camber.  When a car   has an adjustable suspension  these tests are usually done in the  sport   setting  which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of   caveats could go on for page after page.Q  My buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference  according   to his freshman physics textbook  and that you cant ever accelerate   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what hes talking about A  1  in short   he hasnt got a clue.   2  in more detail  the equations for friction used in freshman physics   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth   dry and non deformable    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating   temperature.   Pavement is _never_ smooth  it is always irregular to a greater or lesser   extent.  Tires  which are not really dry and solid  as rubber is a   substance which in its natural form is liquid  and which has only been   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic   deform to match   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire   at operating temperature  grip is actually generated by shear stresses   inside the deformed rubber  and not by anything even remotely resembling   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire   is relative to its operating temperature  the closer its behaviour will   be to the traditional concept of friction  if much hotter than the its   proper operating temperature  the more likely the possibility of some   part of the tire actually   reverting to liquid  which is mostly like   to happen deep in the tread  causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    This latter  though  is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal   street driving  so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of   high speed track driving  dont worry about it.    Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all  thus dragsters   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply  it is actually possible   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques   such as Finite Element Analysis  due to the complexity of the mechanism.Misc.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW Audi     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some    financial difficulty  there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future  but this    is only speculation at this time.   richard welty        518 393 7228       welty cabot.balltown.cma.com  Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis     Carroll Smith

 Choleric  and The Great NT NF Semantic War ,Organization  York UniversityLines  64 Cross posted from alt.psychology.personality since it talks about physicians personalities.  Apologies to sci.med readers not familiar with the Myers Briggs  NT NF  personality terms.  But  in a word or two  the NTs  iNtuitive  Thinkers  are approximately your philosophy science tech pragmatic types  and the NFs  iNtuitive Feelers  are your humanities social  science  theology idealistic types.  They hate each others guts       but tend to inter marry. The letter  J  is a reference to conscienciousness decisiveness. Jon Noring emits typical NF type stuff    Physicians  are just responding in their natural way   Hyper Choleric Syndrome  HCS .  ..  ..it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of  physicians will type out as NT ..  One driving characteristic of an NT  especially an NTJ  is their obvious  choleric behavior  driver  type A  etc.    the extreme emotional need to  control  to lead  and or to be the best or the most competent. ..Please get it right  Jon. This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes  because the NFs of this world are fouling the once pristine NT intellectual nest with their verbal poop. The dominant correlation is NT     Phlegmatic  and _not_ NT     Choleric .One of the semantic roots of  choleric  is the idea of  hot   emotional and one of the semantic roots of  phlegmatic  is  cold   unemotional .Here is a thumbnail sketch  taken from Hans Eysenck  refering to Wundt relating the Ancient Greek quadratic typology with modern terms                                                                                                                Emotional                                                Melancholic                                           Choleric                                                                 Thoughtful Suspicious          Quickly aroused Hotheaded                  Unhappy Worried        Egocentric Histrionic                           Anxious      Exhibitonist                              Serious   Active            Unchangeable                                                     Changeable                                Calm   Playful                                   Reasonable     Carefree              Steadfast Persistent       Hopeful Sociable     Highly principled Controlled         Controlled Easy going                                                          Phlegmatic                                             Sanguine                                                                             v                               Non emotional                                                                              I suspect that your characterisation of NTs as  choleric  is whatyou psych types call a  projection  of your own NF ness onto us.  Maybe we need more NF doctors.     Perhaps in serious pediatics and  my little boys got a runnynose  doctor  general practice  but  please God  not in neurology opthamology  urology  etc. etc.  And NF psychiatry should seperatefrom NT  i.e. real  psychiatry and be given a new name .. something like  channeling      .  tony nexus.yorku.ca   Tony Wallis  York University  Toronto  Canada

Later that same night I noticed that the terms in the were  different from the terms I had agreed to.   I made the stupid mistake  of not checking everything on the contract .  This all happened last  Saturday.  I have heard that there is a  cooling off  law allowing me three days  to reconsider the contract.  Is this true   Can anyone point me to the  law   The transaction happened at the dealership  if it matters. This cooling off period applies only in certain situations   lik ewhen you are solicited at home.  I also think the cooling off period ends if you actually accept the merchandise. If this were not the case  any car buyer would have the right to return a slightly used  highly devalued  car 2 days after buying it.  Yeah    thats the trick   if I want to buy a new car  Id have a firend buy    return one  then go in and negotiate a better deal on a pre owned used car.FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLYOn the other hand  if it can be proven  its possible the changed terms could be thrown out.  The question will be whether the agreement contains a merger clause.  See UCC   2 202  parol evidence .  If were talking about warranties  then  of course  UCC   2 316 should be looked at.But we have so little information that none of us can say anything conclusive.

If you take a rigid definition of scientific research  the mere accumulation of data is not doing science.  One of the early arguments against the project were that the resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics related problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  The project cant be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.

Armenian Nazi Collaboration During World War II ,Reply To  sera zuma.UUCP  Serdar Argic Distribution  worldLines  51In article  2BC0D53B.20378 news.service.uci.edu  tclock orion.oac.uci.edu  Tim Clock  writes  Is it possible to track down  zuma  and determine who what where  seradr   is  Done. But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920  the Armenian Government ordered  incited  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race  religionand national origin  By the way  you still havent corrected yourself.During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might andcringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal  the Armenian publicationin Germany  Hairenik  carried statements as follows  1  Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements  the Jews  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease  and when it  becomes necessary for a people  the Nazis  to eradicate them in an uncommon method  these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation  the flow of blood is a natural thing.  Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews  extracts from a letter dated December 11  1983  published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle  as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.  ...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities  against our people  Jews ...Members of our family witnessed the   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum  Turkey  by Armenian   neighbors  bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish   and or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war  on his premise   to grant them self government if  in return  the Armenians would   help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of  the anti Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian   I dont need your bias.     Signed Elihu Ben Levi  Vacaville  California. 1  James G.

Why not concentrate    ,Organization  AT TLines  63In article  1993Apr15.170731.8797 isc br.isc br.com  steveh thor.isc br.com  Steve Hendricks  writes   These two paragraphs are from two different posts.  In splicing them   together it is not my intention to change Steves meaning or misrepresent  him in any way.  I dont  think  Ive done so.   As noted in another thread  Limiting govt   the problem libertarians face is insuring that the  limited government  they seek does not become the  tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda.   It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just as Marxism  fails  to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to  wither away   libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition.Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois  USA requiringanyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year  X   10  I think to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition  it requirs anyonewith a used car dealers license to own at least 10 cars at a time  all thetime. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steves questions.Steve  lets say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resellcars.  Either youve gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bumpup against these limits  or you would like to do it full time but thesestupid  arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pullingyourself up.  So Im protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willingto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs  and youreprotected from doing what you want with your life.Heres what I see libertarianism offering you Your money is truly yours  it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.If you use it to buy a car  it is truly your car  it belongs to you.  Youcan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car  you can sellthat car.Your life is truly yours  it belongs to you.  It matters not if someonethinks that its  wrong  for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 monthsrather than  say  9 cars.  They may dissaprove  but it is not their life ortheir money  it is your life and your money.My money is truly mine  it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car  the one that someone  somewheredissaproves of you selling and  presumably  of me buying.That someone could go to the government and insist that the government makeus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doingwhat we like with our own property  in the abscence of fraud or agression.And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream  but basic human decencyand common sense.  A real grass roots example of freedom and liberty.And yes  not having a few people acting as our masters  approving orrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other  does strike meas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.   Thanks awfully              Patrick

NASA  Wraps ,News Software  VAX VMS VNEWS 1.41    Nntp Posting Host  tm0006.lerc.nasa.govOrganization  NASA Lewis Research Center   Cleveland  OhioLines  133In the April edition of  One Small Step for a Space Activist  Allen Sherzer   Tim Kyger write    Another problem is what are called wraps  or sometimes   the center tax . When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center  the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that  Of the  30 billion cost of Freedom  fully  10   billion wont be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations  Now  maybe that  10 billion   was wisely spent  and maybe it wasnt   but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits  not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps  Congress has never heard the   term center tax. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesnt add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else. My dear friends  your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago  when I first read this in your posting  Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters  if you wondering why I didnt post aresponse immediately  I do have a real job Im supposedto be doing here at Headquarters    digging up old 20 kHzdata   looking into Sherzer Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also  I spent last weekendin Kansas City  at the National Science Teachers Association conference  extolling the virtues of SSFto 15 000 science teachers. First off  yes  the concept of center tax  or wrap doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly  the total taxfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around  40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP 1  WP 2  and WP 4center taxes. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at 2.2 Billion  my calculater says the tax percentage is04 2.2   1.8 Over the life of the SSF program  using your figure of  30billion for the cost of SSF  a tax at a 1.8  rate comes to 540 million. This is alot less than  10 billion  but Iwill concede its still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1 3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center  kind of like McDonalds at somestates  where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant  but you dont if you get ittake out . For example  at WP 4  the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract  and are  NOT subject to the center tax  I dont have the numbers infront of me  but Id guess at least 95  of the WP 4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne . So  you could be right about a taxrate of 1 3  but its only applied to funds spent at thecenter  and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question  What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that dont go to the prime contractors  i.e. ok  WP 4 gets a slice of the  30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds  which arent eatenup by the center tax   At WP 4  we call these funds we spend in house supportingdevelopment funds  as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne . We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed  to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field  left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back   with lead acid car batteries to simulate the Nickel Hydrogen batteries on SSF   DCswitchgear  DC DC converter units  and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries  which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point  6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18 552 to 23 405 cycles  theon orbit batteries go through 5 840 cycles per year .As a final example  my home division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations  for performing systemanalyses  like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system  availability calculationsusing a Monte Carlo simulation  setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements .Finally  the money raised by the tax does not allgo into a slush fund. At Lewis  the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax  however  goes to fund the generalservices at the Center  like the library  the central computer services division  the Contractor who removes the snow  etc. Thus  it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesnt go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure  you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library  for example  and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF  which would be hard tocompute by itself   how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is billable to SSF  would you base it onthe person hours SSF employees spend reading AV weekversus the rest of the center personnel . You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library  butwe underpay for snow removal  Talk abouta burecratic nightmare My last point is that I cant believe your claim thatCongress has never heard of the term center tax.Unfortunately  all of the NASA testimony beforeCongress isnt on a computer  so I cant do a simpleword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely in some GAO audit somewhere  these NASA cost methodswere documented for Congress 
text of White House announcement and Q As on clipper chip encryption ,"Lines  22		The majority of the discussion involving this  Clipper Chip  seems to	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog	signals   The language sort of suggests this  but its hard to say.Id lay a few bucks that its just data in data out in parallel.  I suspectto make it a phone youd need a codec and speech compression.  There wouldbe a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal  which I suspect would scupperany of the suggestions Ive seen here about putting a different encryptionfront end on it.Theres no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  Im sure its purelya digital chip.  The back end will come later  but Im  positive  it wontbe left to the manufacturers   they all have to be the same modulationscheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones. Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true  bwahahaha       G"
Non turbo speed,Organization  The University of Western AustraliaLines  17NNTP Posting Host  tartarus.uwa.edu.auX Newsreader  Tin 1.1 PL5Nic Percival  x5336   nmp mfltd.co.uk  wrote     Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine  and very nice it is too.  One query   the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz    thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its  7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button  that turns it into a skateboard.    Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of  turbo vs non turbo   I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of  about 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.

The arrogance of Christians,Organization  Monash University   Melbourne. Australia.Lines  96In article  Apr.19.05.11.41.1993.29112 athos.rutgers.edu   aa888 freenet.carleton.ca  Mark Baker  writes   I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I dont know if this is  believeing blindly or not. Im not sure how blindness comes into it. I do   notdeny reason  indeed I insist upon it  but reason only draws conclusions   fromevidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on   theevidence of the five physical senses  then you cut reason off from any  possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere  beyond the  rather provocative  if inconclusive  conclusion that the physical sphere   isnot self explanatory . So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences  sincethis is the only other source of information left to us .How can you then convince somebody that your  feelings and experiences are the correct ones then if you cant show somebody visible andmeasurable effects   If my experiences say that  there exists no god and yours says there does  where does that leave us   Since we are onlygoing on experiences  then both of us are correct within our own personalrealities.Furthermore  the trouble with  feelings and experiences  is that theycan lead you astray  as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  Iam sure that many of Koreshs followers really believed in him butI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.Finally  how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physicalsphere is not self explanatory when you only rely on the five senses   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence    which they call faith  and which is a gift of God. That is  this evidence  is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The   evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning  on the evidence of the senses wont help either. But Christians do reason  of the evidence of faith  and do claim that this evidence is wholly  consistent with the evidence of the other senses  and indeed  that the  evidence of these other senses is part of Gods revelation of himself  to us.You must be using a definition of  evidence  that I am not familiar with.To me  evidence is something you can show others  unambiguously  thatwhat you are saying is true.However  I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.It is not something you can share around   others must experience itindependantly.  Unfortunately  as I have explained above  this putsbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christiansdo not have the monopoly on reason  evidence and faith as far as any ofthese things can go.  In a previous article  phs431d vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au    says     You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However  if  we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since  we can only use faith  why is one picture of  God   e.g. Hinduism  any less  valid than another  e.g. Christianity      Faith  as I have said  is not opposed to reason  it is simply a new source   of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings  have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses  and  similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by  faith. Religious believers in general  and Christians in particular  use  reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding  of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims  with good reason  to be  the most valid system for explaining the physical universe  and Christianity  claims  also with good reason  to be the most valid system  possessed of the  best evidence  for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.At the risk of repeating my argument   As I have explained previously  the trouble is that Moslems  Buddhists  Jews  etc will ALL say that THEYclaim  with good reason  to be a valid system  possessed of the bestevidence  for explaining Gods revelations to man  for Buddhists itshould read  for explaining the non existence of God  .  So not onlymust you  prove  your own case  you have to  disprove  theirs. alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the beliefof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons   If you doubt that Christians use reason  read this newsgroup for a while  and you will see rational debate aplenty.I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they dont.I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well founded.  It goeswithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correctme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the non essential and contradictory bits  we should  hopefully  have madesome progress towards the truth.                                                                                       Mark Baker                     The task ... is not to cut down jungles  but   aa888 Freenet.carleton.ca     to irrigate deserts.     C. S.

Protection of serial  RS232  lines,Organization  National University of SingaporeX Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL6 Lines  39Martin John Gregory  mgregory flash.pax.tpa.com.au  wrote   Ive started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission  over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments  and have  seen a variety of schemes for protecting the RS232 transceivers  and  the rest of the circuit  from transients on the serial lines.  Im  left wondering what is the best way of doing this   How necessary is  it    stuff deleted   What is the wisdom on this out there     Ta     Martin.    From what I know  protection is necessary  esp. if you plan to routethe cables into an unknown environment  out of your control . Thingslike accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables  oreven lightning strikes are very likely and I dont think you like to seethe sight of your computer going up in smoke   Even ethernet cards areprotected. Ive looked at the one in my PC and the connector isprotected by a gas discharge tube   But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings  i.e. incontrolled environments   it should be reasonably safe not to havethem. Suggestion  look in the RS data book. They have several RS232transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include theLT1080  LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to beelectrically isolated ones but still need opto isolators to work  dontask me why. Ive never used them before.Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector.

DID HE REALLY RISE   ,Organization  The Claremont Graduate SchoolLines  58In article  Apr.19.05.10.33.1993.29070 athos.rutgers.edu   Gene.Gross lambada.oit.unc.edu  Gene Gross  writes     Of course they knew where it was. Dont forget that Jesus was seen by both  the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didnt   need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus body to   make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a   man well know to the Sanhedrin  to say that they didnt know where He was  buried begs the question.Here again  the problem with most of the individuals posting here  you take thebiblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in themodern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross ThatSpoke_  Pub. Harper and Row  1988 .  The earliest texts which we have make noreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim ofresurrection. Modern Evangelicals Fundamentalists have completely missed whatthe point of resurrection is    Here the work of George Nickelsburgs work _Resurrection  Immortality  and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_  PublCambridge  Havard Univ. Press  1972  is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1 1 3.  Paulhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15  Here again thereis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised  note the passive   he appeared no ascension either.Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in thegrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isnt broached in any of our textsuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time  the idea of coming upwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued  convicingly I think  that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark  we have no textsbefore this which mention the tomb .         Now  you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on  this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a   deliberate lie   If not  then why do you think the disciples would   Now  Im  not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth    but unbeknown to you  it is a lie. Many have done this. No  Im talking about  dying  by beheading  stoning  crucifixion  etc.  for something you know to  be a lie  Thus  you position with regards to the disciples stealing the   body seems rather lightweight to me.    As for graverobbers  why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over   the body of Jesus  He wasnt buried with great riches. So  again  this is  an argument that can be discounted.    That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body         Again  let me comment that the most plausible non Christian scenario   and the one typically suggested by sceptics who are knowledgeable  about the NT  is that the resurrection was a subjective event  and the  empty tomb stories are a result of accounts growing in the telling.    clh You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as thefoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.randy

Radar detector DETECTORS ,Organization  Kansas State UniversityLines  23NNTP Posting Host  matt.ksu.ksu.eduragee vdoe386.vak12ed.edu  Randy Agee  writes  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more   Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right  a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was  no way    But  guess again  these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one  and he could never figure out where it was   but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passivedevice much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna pickingup that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there wouldbe no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be ofdetecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  Neal Howlandnhowland matt.ksu.ksu.edu

I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved forfurther enhancements to the Motorola line  rather than meted out toanother company. Ah  well  I guess thats what I get when I assume thecomputer industry will operate in a logical manner     In article  1993Apr16.212441.34125 rchland.ibm.com  Ricardo HernandezMuchado  ricardo rchland.vnet.ibm.com writes     Sean  I dont want to get into a mini war by what I am going to say  but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris  youll see why  please  no flames  I reserve those for c.s.m.a           I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show  and Apple hada booth there.  I walked by  and they were showing real time video capture using a  Radious or SuperMac   card to digitize and make right on thespot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one  1.5 .Version 1.5 of Quicktime is  as has been stated  the current version ofthe software. The older version is 1.0  and 1.6 is on the horizon in thenot too distant future.    They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It playedback quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window  resized  to25x by 3xx  320 in y I think  and the frame rate decreased enough to noticethat it wasnt 30fps  or about 30fps  anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Thenhe increased it just a bit more  and it dropped to 10   12 fps. Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than itdoes playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expandingeach frames image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriatebit depth is pretty processor intensive. There are optimizers that workpretty well for showing movies at double size  but if you drop to 1.9xsize or increase to 2.1x size  performance suffers dramatically.    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra dont know what model  900   to do it  and he was telling the guys there that theQuicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.He lied.     Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused bythe fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode  and will play in thesame amount of time on any machine. However  an LC will drop frames inorder to keep the sound and video synced up.The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similarperformance  though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginallyfaster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.    Well  I spoiled his claim so to say  since a 68040 Quadra Mac washaving a little bit of trouble.  And this wasnt even from the hardisk   Thiswas from memory      Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime  or some hardware assisted Centris  or another software product running the  animation  like supposedly MacroMinds Accelerator   I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0    Iwas using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearlytwice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.The Centris 650 I saw was a plain vanilla  with the exception of the nicespeakers that were playing the sound  and the software was Movie Player the QT player Apple includes with the software.    Dont misunderstand me  I just want to clarify this.No problem    it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do thethings it does as well as it can.

What exactly did I claim                                                             Ive heard eye witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.                                                              I wasnt wrong . . . Ive heard those descriptions.  If youre  paying attention  Ive mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own  eyes  but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps  people judge whether or not to kick in the  to use your words    bullshit filters .  Stating that I  claimed  this is a falsehood.  Later in the same post      Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building  were burnt  some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember  I was and  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.Fine   now  you are stating that you believe their claims  or that you are inclined  to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs .  Thoseclaims are still ludicrous  however.Previously Awesley had written   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.Prompting me to write   To fire fragmentary grenades   I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion  grenades   Perhaps.  To fire tear gas   Certainly.  But you would be  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags  wouldnt you  since  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.To which Awesley replied   John  again  strawman techniques.  Do you feel youre losing it so you  have to stretch what I said and knock that down   What I read said  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you  need some help  let me know and Il take your side of this for a  while.  Youre not scoring here  youre boring here.But why did you mention grenade launchers at all   Because it supports thenotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notionbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  Butthat too is ludicrous.I wrote   If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit  people would have been  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about  it. Awesley relied      Glad to know youre such an expert.  Nice to hear some an  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge    if it  had happened  you would have know it.  Since you are such an  authority  you probably know that people did scream about an alleged  massive cover up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.  Some claimed 100  dead  others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was  several .  Ive also  heard some things about that but I wont dare repeat them.  Youd  assert that I claimed they were truth.Yes  if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. Army tanks dont fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960swithout it becoming common knowledge  without minority leaders seizing onit and condemning it over and over again  without civil libertarians saying this has gone far enough.   So  yes  my never hearing of it was the basisfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. Not one poster has written to say  yes  I lived in Detroit at that time andeverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If ithad happened  somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore  your ownresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim isextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence  extraordinary or not. Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  Ido not.I wrote   Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. Awesley wrote      Taking the tour after the riots  it was pretty easy to tell the   difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26   years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.  So it would have been an Army cover up.Quibble.  Fine  it was an Army cover up.  Six years in the Reserves hastaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and halfdecades not one guilt ridden participant has come forward and said  yes  Ishelled Americans   or  I gave the orders to fire the cannons   or  Ihelped cover it up  I wrote   If your mind is open enough to believe that  well  good for you.  Iprefer  to live in reality.   And here in reality  I find it hard to believe that  those tanks even had any shells  much less fired them.Awesley replied     Given the level in destruction in Detroit  Im quite willing to believe  that they did fire their guns.Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. Your belief fails a basic reality check  why isnt it known Awesley concludes      Now then  weve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read  this far and all youve managed to say is that you dont believe the  account I cited.Actually  now we have established that I dont believe what you believe  aswell as why I dont believe it.  And if its boring  then I yield the lastword to you  if you want it.  You may say anything you like withimpunity  I am dropping the subject.  John L. Scott

It has nothing to do with refractive error  however.    I recall reading seeing that former baseball star Chris Chambliss hitting  abilities were  in part  attributed to a combination of left handedness    right eye dominance. I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona tosee whether cross dominant individuals  those with a particular handednessbut who had dominance in the opposite eye  were better hitters thanthose with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked frommy softball class because I was cross dominant  right hand  left eye which put me in a small minority  and the grad student was trying to getan equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people .  Tocontrol the study  she used a pitching machine   fast pitch.  SinceI was used to slow pitch  I didnt come close  actually I thinkI foul tipped a few  to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of peoplelike me in her study  i.e.  those who cant hit fast pitch  or arenot used to hitting off a machine    I would seriously question theresults of that study    I think there have been some studies of majorleague players  across a fairly large cross section of players  to testwhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was  better   but I dont know the results.   The woman who ran the study I was insaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in majorleaguers than across the general population   but Im not surewhether Id believe her.

We know that early Christians  suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example   ACT 5 40   41    It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion  to even hearing Jesuss name....  Finally  the first apostles death  James of Zebedee was certainly  not by Romes hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. ...  The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection  then one  must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He  stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would  have been extremely difficult for some people  especially those  that had plotted to kill Him. The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance onthe biblical text.  Lukes account is highly suspect  I would refer you tothe hermeneia commentary on Acts .  Moreover Lukes account is written atleast 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has diedand attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come upwith only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.Moreover  Pauls account of some of the events in Acts  as recorded in Galatians  fail to establish the acts accounts. What we need  therefore  is a reliable text  critically appreciated  whichdocuments the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I wouldsuggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will bedisapointed.randy

A. Wells             There is a great fallacy in your statement. The question of origins is         based on more than science alone.        Nope  no fallacy.  Yep  science is best in determining how  religions handle   why and who.     Rich  I am curious as to why you and others award custody of the baby to theists and religion I hope I didnt award custody  Rich.  I purposely used  handle  in order to avoid doing so   i.e.  that happens to be what religions do  of course there areaberrations like  scientific  creationism .  I used  best  in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who  so these domains aremostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief  which no doubt confused thematter.  As an aside  for science I should have written  how and when .  Nobodyseems to argue over what. Are they  theists  theologians  any better equiped to investigate the  who and  why  than magicians  astrologers  housewives  not being sexists   athiests or  agnostics.Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  Im nottrying to be evasive on this  but from a societal perspective  religion works.On the other hand  sometimes it is abused and misused  and many suffer  whichyou know.  But the net result seems positive  this from the anthropologicalperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo Fruedian insofar as I think the masses cant get along without religion.  Not that generally they are incapable  they just dont  and for myriad reasons  but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive  that immortality.  Therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to  who and why .  I suggest that this holds regardless of the  truth  in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  In the end  spiritual beliefs are just as  real  as scientific facts and explanation  CAUTION TO SOME  DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT .   Do you suggest that the  who and why  will forever be closed to scientific  investigation No.  In fact  I dont think it is closed now  at least for some individuals. Isnt there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity   This approach might presuppose an absence of who and why  except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing   Maybe that something doesnthave to be supernatural  maybe just mechanistic.  But thats a tough one forpeople today to grasp.  In any case  theory without empirical data is not explanation  but then your question does not require data.  In other words  I agree that theorizing  within scientific parameters  is just as scientific as explaining.  So the answer is  who and why are not closed to scientists  but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will be necessary for improvement  and that seems a long way off  if ever.  Pretty convoluted here  I hope Ive made sense.   It seems to me that 200 or so years ago  the question of the origin of life on earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way   the  questions  of how  when  who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment  reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when  and not  for the most part  who and why.  Science was thus born out of the naturalists curiosity  eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant  the selfish  the intolerant  andthe arrogant  of course  still claim authority in all four domains.   Rich Fox  Anthro  Usouthdakota Did like your discussion around AMHs  and I did figure out what AMH was from your original post    Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things  isnt it   Well  I amsure there are plenty of  scientific  creationist  rebuttals  out there somewhere  even if they have to be created from nothing. just for the record  again  AMH   anatomically modern humans  Best regards     Rich Fox  Anthro  Usouthdakota

Thanks in advance    NadineWhat is best  Books have been written on that  But in regard toAeroStich it really depends on your particular size  shape and needs.If you upper and lower body are not proportional  according to aerodimensions  then it probably is going to be better mixing and matchingthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road  I am veryconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference inprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. Ithink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of adifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you gosomewhere and then want to walk around for a while  still with jacket you can just detach and stow the pants. One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit formany women  with standard suits . Supposedly for smaller women  andpetite men for that matter  the 1 piece will fit better. Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish Igot 2 3 inches added to my pant legs.

Ive eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went    with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered    lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that    meal was the first course  scallops served in the shell with a soy type sauce.    I thought   Well  Ive only had scallops once and I was sick after but that    could have been a coincidence . That night as I sat on the bathroom floor     sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way  I decided I would never touch    another scallop. I may not be allergic but I dont want to take the chance.I dont react to scallops  but did have discomforts with clam juiceserved at  American  waterfront seafood bars.  I dont know whetherthe juice is homemade or from cans.The following is my first encounter with the Chinese RestaurantSyndrome.  Ten years ago  about an hour after having Won Ton Soup Icollapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up  my scalptingling  my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for about20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction  Iwent back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  Thesame thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothingout of the ordinary.Ive also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant."

The BATF needs more people  better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of ours.
