WHAT car is this  ,"Article I.D.  reed.1993Apr21.032905.29286Reply To  rseymour reed.eduOrganization  Reed College  Portland  ORLines  26In article  1993Apr20.174246.14375 wam.umd.edu  lerxst wam.umd.edu  wheres my  thing  writes      I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw  the other day. It was a 2 door sports car  looked to be from the late 60s   early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In  addition   the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is   all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name  engine specs  years  of production  where this car is made  history  or whatever info you  have on this funky looking car  please e mail.Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather  odd looking with the encased front bumper. There arent a lot of them around   but Hemmings  Motor News  ususally has ten or so listed. Basically  they are a  performance Ford with new styling slapped on top.          brought to you by your neighborhood Lerxst     Rush fan   Robert Seymour				rseymour reed.eduPhysics and Philosophy  Reed College	 NeXTmail accepted Artificial Life Project			Reed CollegeReed Solar Energy Project  SolTrain 	Portland  OR"
Israeli Terrorism,Lines  33Anas Omran writes in his earlier posting    A high rank Israeli officer was killed during a clash whith a Hamas...and then his  fantasy  begins... Mujahid.  The terrorist Israelis chased and killed a young Mujahid using anti tank missiles.  The terrorist zionists cut the Mujahids body into small pieces to the extend that his body was not recognized. At leat ten houses were destroyed by these atni tank missiles.       Anas Omran   This clearly is a  fantastic  story  Anas   I am very curious as to who or what  your sources are for this grossly exaggerated account  if not blatant lie .  It surprises me that this  story  has not yet made it tothe front pages of the major newspapers  which love to make the State ofIsrael look as evil as humanly possible    Such a story would be  eaten up by some of the papers over here.  So please explain to me why I have neverseen nor heard of it before     Believe me  Im not expecting a reply becausewe both know where the story came from...

Another question.   Well  not strictly r.m. stuff  I am looking for a thermos flask to keep coffee hot. I mean real  hot  Of course it must be the unbreakable type. So far  what ever  metal type I have wasted money on has not matched the vacuum glass   type.  Any info appreciated.  SanjayBack in my youth  ahem  the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated upwater from a 12V source.  It was for car use but we thought wed try it on myRD350B.  It worked OK apart from one slight problem  we had to keep the revs above 7000.  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.It made for interesting cups of coffee  anyhow.  We would plot routes thatcontained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time toget the water to boiling point.  This is sometimes difficult in England.Good luck on your quest.

Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise  If hes not  I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  Its theone who knows what hes doing  and why  that will be faster.  It  may be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is through trial and error  but it is not very effective methodology.Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can oneimprove on that technique  I hold that this applies to any humanendeavor . thats all it is   an interesting bit of knowledge  and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it  or that you can corner faster or better as a result  is absurd.Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction managementpolicy without understanding what it is or what factors increase ordecrease available traction   Braking It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximumswerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For mostof his riding life this may not be a problem  but in an emergencysituation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage. But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily  right at the time when there are  far  more important matters for them to learn.I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses whichteach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a mannerthat is neither confusing  nor detracts from any other aspects of thecourse. And that was my original point.Perhaps  but in the ensuing discussion  you strayed far from thatpoint  to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to ariders ability.

Jews Islam  Dr  Frankenstien,Nntp Posting Host  gate koi.corp.sgi.comReply To  kaveh gate koi.corp.sgi.com  Kaveh Smith  Organization  Silicon Graphics  Inc.  Mountain View  CA  USALines  49I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity andIslam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone  religion wars are going to be on the raise. I thought the idea of believing on one God  was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believeon the same God   the God of Ebrahim  are killing each other  Is this like Dr. Frankenstiens story How are you going to stop this from happening  How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them would distroy the whole world  Would God get mad  since you have killed his followers  you believe on the sameGod  same heaven and the same hell after all  What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga Man kind needs religion  since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.The praying  keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray  but man kind hopesthat God will help him when he prays.Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the religious leaders need to make a living through religion  So they  may corrupt it  or turn it to their own way tomake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay   20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets hiscut too  Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other  be good toward each otherhelps one another  respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today   Is in it that within every man there is good and bad  he could choose either one  then he willsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stopanother religious killing field  under poor Gods name  What are your thoughts  Do you think man kind wouldto come its senses  before it is too late P.S. on the sideDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina  Why would God go to top of the mountain  He createdthe earth  he could have been anywhere  why on top the mountain  Was it because people thought to see Godyou have to reach to the skies heavens  Why God kept coming back to Middle East  Was it because they createdGod through their imagination   Is that why Jewish people were told by God  they were the chosen ones Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taughthim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah  sp  old testement . Do you think God wrote Quran Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammadwanted to expand his trade business  Is that why  God has put his house in there  I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.Look at David Koresh  how that turned out  I am afraid in the bigger scale  the Jews and the Muslims willhave the same ending        Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things  rather thanplotting each others distruction.  There is one earth  One life and one God. Lets all man kind be good towardeach other.God help us all.Peace

I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group  from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5 different groups out of this is a wate  and will only result in a few posts a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way  Just curious.   Daemon Actuallay I dont  but on the other hand I dont support the idea of havingone newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian in his reply to my original posting.I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer comp.graphics.hw_and_swThe reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason yousay we shouldnt spilt up  not to get to few postings every day.I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or three Im interested in.I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in onemeeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas help others or to be helped.

So  given a line L and a polygon P  we can write a PostScript program that  draws the line L and the polygon P  and then  outputs  the answer.  By   output   we mean the program executes a command called  showpage   which  actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.

Rodney King Trial  Civil Rights Violations  Double Jeopardy,Organization  NCR Engineering and Manufacturing Atlanta    Atlanta  GALines  37In  1993Apr2.182942.22445 husc3.harvard.edu  spanagel husc11.harvard.edu  David Spanagel  writes  Recently its occured to me that Ive never heard of any PERSON ever being tried in Federal Court for violating someones civil rights. Of course there have been cases before the Supreme Court in which it was decided that someones civil rights had been violated  e.g.  Miranda  Escobedo  etc.   but institutions were  de facto  the defendants  not individuals. Am I mistaken  Have there been similar cases against individuals in the past  I know it was used several times in the south  to prosecute the murders ofblacks  after all white juries had cleared the accussed. Furthermore  what are the specific charges against the four LAPD officers   Which civil rights or laws are they accused of violating  I believe it is a general charge  that is no specific right is mentioned. What about double jeopardy  Has there been any concern that a verdict against Koon  et al. might be overturned upon appeal because theyre being tried again for the same actions   I thought I heard something on the news about  this. The SS has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were inessence seperate sovereigns  then double jeopardy does not apply. If this is true  then could defendents also be tried under city andcounty governments  This mornings paper said that the ACLU has decided to reinstate itsopposition to this kind of thing. They had earlier suspended theiropposition while they examined the King case. There might be hopefor the ACLU after all.

Thats a revisionist account of what happened.  Gritz was well awareof Dukes presence on the ticket.  Given that Gritz is not at all shyabout associating and promoting other white supremacists  such as theChristian Identity movement or Willis Carto   whatever reasons Gritzhad to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Dukes presence.  So Gritz gave up his  chance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting  Duke.  Id hardly call that  giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US   the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil.  Still  it does imply that he doesnt want to be associated with Duke.I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time witha photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke.   ted frank                   thf2 kimbark.uchicago.edu           Im sorry  the card says  Moops. the u of c law school       standard disclaimers

Really nice I must say. Very attractive styling  lots of features and room   at a competitive price.    Unfortunately  the workmanship is quite disappointing. On BOTH cars  the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come off easily.Lack of build quality was the thing  I notced on the first 2 LHs Isaw months back. The panel gaps were large and non uniform betweenthe 2 cars I saw   the kind of thing you expect and accept on aMustang   but not from Chryslers savior.  I drove one of the lowend cars  and thought it was more than adequate.

Jews believe that their sins are atoned for with blood sacrifice of animals as described in the Old Testament.When was the last time you heard about a Jewish animal sacrifice  Christians  believe that their sins are atoned for by the blood sacrifice of Jesus.The blood sacrifice of an innocent man  This does not make the Law irrelevant.Then why dont Christians follow it  why dont they even follow theirown Ten Commandments  Breaking the Law  is  sinful  and we are to avoid sinful ways  but sinning  by itself  does not jeopardize salvation.So  in short  Hitler is in heaven and Gandhi is in Hell  Note that Im not a theologian.

Butthere would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to consider the negative side  Law abiding citizens  armed with fireamrs  pistols for the most part   prevent between 80 000 National Crime Survey  and 1 000 000  Dr. Kleck  crimeseach year.  Those are the extremes. Most studies findthe number to be 500 000 to 600 000.  About 1  of those crimes arehomicides  so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately5 000 lives each year. There are roughly 12 000 criminal homicidesand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to be any net benefit  you would have to show that gun control measureswould disarm over 40  of the criminals currently using guns.That would be very hard to do  According the the federal BATF only 8  of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Sincegun control laws  by their very nature  only effect legalsales  such a law would remove all the benefits of armed law abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect onarmed criminals  who  by and large  get their guns illegally.  That doesnt sound like a net benefit to me.   ...There were over 250  accidental  handgun homicides in America in 1990  most with licensed weapons.Since most were with licensed weapons  I assume you are notsupporting  reasonable  laws  i.e. waiting periods  backgroundchecks  licenses  etc... . Since only a complete ban would alter the statistic you refer to  I assume thats what youare supporting.By the way  1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.250 accidental handgun deaths isnt significant next to other household accidents. ...More American children accidentally shot other children last year  15  than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning  69 from drinking poisonous household chemicals  like Drano   139 fromfalls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic  accidentaldeaths of children  wouldnt a ban on drain cleaners be a better palce to start   Or  perhaps  restricting ownership toprofessionals like plumbers   ...Please... no dictionary arguments about RATES vs TOTAL NUMBERS  okay   Theyre offered for emphasis  not comparison .While you might call it  emphasis   refering to completely twostatistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison.

 Accepting Jeesus in your heart     ,Organization  University of Oulu  FinlandLines  183First  I thank collectively all people who have given good answersto my questions. In my follow up to Jason Smiths posting  I willaddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding Jason Smith  jasons atlastele.com  wrote   In article  Apr.19.05.13.48.1993.29266 athos.rutgers.edu  kempmp phoenix.oulu.fi  Petri Pihko  writes   I also concede that I was doubly remiss  as I asserted  No reasonable  alternative exists   an entirely subjective statement on my part  and one  that could  be invalidated  given time and further discovery by the  scientist .  I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily  specify that  this is how it happened   but proposes a likely description of  the phenomena in question.  Am I mistaken with this understanding Yes  to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skepticon the nature of scientific work two weeks ago  I hope it did notescape your notice. The correct word is likely. There is no way to be sure our models andtheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence but not proved   no theory can be true in a mathematical sense.However  theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations ofphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theoriesscience has come up with have passed this test  including the BigBang theory of cosmic evolution  the theory of natural selection etc.It does not mean they _must_ be correct  but they are not merebest fits for the data.     But if you claim that there must be    an answer to  how  did the universe  our spacetime   emerge from      nothing   science has some good candidates for an answer.  All of which require something we Christians readily admit to    Faith.Well  yes  if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what sciencerequires   take a good look at the theory and the evidence  see ifthe theory has made any successful predictions  and use your reason.Disbelievers are not punished.   The fact that there are several candidates belies that  none  are conclusive.    With out conclusive evidence  we are left with faith.This is what puzzles me   why do we need to have faith in _anything_ My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist   someone who isunable to believe  ie  fails to entertain any belief in God. Yes  I know that one cant believe without Gods help  Luther makesthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. Im afraid this does notchange my situation.     a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary  we ask  Why does the  universe exist       I think this question should actually be split into two parts  namely        1  Why is there existence  Why anything exists         and        2  How did the universe emerge from nothing  deletions     The question  why anything exists  can be countered by    demanding answer to a question  why there is nothing in nothingness     or in non existence .  Actually  both questions turn out to be    devoid of meaning. Things that exist do  and things that dont exist    dont exist. Tautology at its best.  Carefully examine the original question  and then the  counter question .   The first asks  Why   while the second is a request for definition. No  it is not  although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy either something exists  or nothing exists. If nothing exists  nobodywould ask why. If something exists  it is possible to ask why  butactually no existing being could give an answer. Imagine  for a moment  that the nobodies in non existence could alsoask   Why nothing exists   This is equivalent to my counter question  why nothing exists in nothingness . Now   why anything exists  is equivalent to  why something exists insomethingness .  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology  my apologiesfor the poor wording in my previous post.  I might add  the worldview of  Things that exist do  and things that  dont...dont  is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable   as does the theists belief in God.  It is based on the assumption  that there is  not  a reason for being  something as ultimately   un supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very  foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there  is  a  reason.I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being  or existence in general  for reasons I stated above. However  they will stillleave open the question  why this  and not that   and this is wheretheistic explanations come in.Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human beings existence.  We come to this. Either  I am  therefore I am.   or  I am for a reason. This is a deep philosophical question   is determinism true  or not Also  is God deterministic or not  I tend to think this question hasno meaning in His case. If I am for a reason  Ive yet failed to see what it would be. From our perspective  it looks like I exist for truly randomreasons. I just rolled two dice   why did I get 6 and 1  How canI believe there is any better reason for my existence   If the former is a satisfactory answer  then you are done  for you are  satisfied  and need not a doctor.  If the latter  your search is just  beginning.  Yes  I am satisfied with this reason  until I find something better.My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect  I haveto admit  but I am patient.    Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.    This sounds much better  but I am tempted to ask  Does God    Himself exist  then  If God is the source of His own existence     it can only mean that He has  in terms of human time  always    existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His   qualities   implying He exists to  have  qualities  BTW .No  it doesnt  but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course  thisshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer  why .   It  appears that M. Pihko agrees  as we shall see .  But because a tool is  inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting  that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  It is impossible to know unknowable things. However  the question  why do I exist  in particular  is _not_ an invalid question   thisis not what I said. But from our perspective  it is impossible totell  and I cant just believe in any given explanation instead ofanother  especially since I found I was deluding myself.   My apologies.  I was using why as  why did this come to be .  Why did  pre existence become existence.  Why did pre spacetime become spacetime.I think  pre existence  is an oxymoron. There is no time outside ofthis spacetime  except in some other universe   and from that perspective  our universe never was. It exists only for those whoare inside it.   But we come to the admission that science fails to answer  Why  .  Because  it cant be answered in the realm of modern science  does that make the  question invalid No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately  I thinkphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known  and what is notknowable   M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask  What do I   as an individual Christian base my faith on    Will it be shaken by the  production of evidence that shatters our  sacred cows  or will we seek to  understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God  said   and  continues to say  in his Word This is a very good question. In trying to answer this  and numerousother questions that bothered me  I finally found nothing to basemy faith on. I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves   why do I believe or  why I dont believe . Petri   ___. . .         Petri Pihko    kem pmp           Mathematics is the Truth. ___.  .   .

Minority Abuses in Greece ,Reply To  sera zuma.UUCP  Serdar Argic Distribution  worldLines  201In article  C60B63.G2M panix.com  mpoly panix.com  Michael S. Polymenakos  writes   Well  ZUMABOT claims just the opposite  That Greeks are not allowing Turks to exit the country. Now  explain this  The number of Turks in Thrace has steadily risen from 50 000 in 23 to 80 000  while the Greeks ofDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed. I have been observing that Poly has been practicing Goebels rule quite loyally. Polys audience is mostly made of Greeks who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However  in todays informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For instance  those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what really happened. There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital  The Greek Girls Lycee Alumni Association  the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society  the Greek Medical Foundation  the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation  the Yovakimion Greek Girls Lycee Foundation  and the Fener Greek Mens Lycee Foundation.  As for Greece  the longstanding use of the adjective Turkish in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers Association  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turksin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to removethe word Turkish on their buildings and on their officialpapers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict  November 4  1987  of the Greek High Court.In the city of Komotini  a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkishparentage  was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonmentwith no right to appeal  just for saying outloud that he wasof Turkish descent. This duly elected ethnic Turkish officialwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle  used by the Greek governments  to cover up their inferiority complex they display  vis a vis  the people of Turkiye. The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term Turks  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to Muslims. The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The Pomaks are also a Muslim people  whom all the three nations  Bulgarians  Turks  and Greeks  consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements  Poor Poly.It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkishminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition in 1980 the democratic Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091 virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar andother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self supportingreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus  irrespectiveof the will of the Turkish minority  as state official. Althoughthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters inGreece  the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electingits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction  which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage  is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the so called Greek Constitution  which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece  on the other hand  is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region.And you pondered. Sidiropoulos  the president of the Macedonian Human Rights Committee  became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation  Sidiropoulos has been sent to internal exile on the island of Kefalonia  hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. His employer  the Florina City Council  asked him to depart in 24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice and remains without a job. Helsinki Watch  a well known Human Rights group  had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990  their findings were published in a report titled  Destroying Ethnic Identity  Turks of Greece.The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction  which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage  is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlikwere attacked  and tombstones were broken. The cemetery inKarotas was razed by bulldozers.Shall I go on  Why not  The people of Turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turksin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile  Greek and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern Cyprus  a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.An acceptable method may certainly be found when thereis a will. But we know of various kinds of violentbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burningof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.Now wait  there is more.  Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna  May to July 1919   Inedited  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers  Published by  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne  Lausanne   Imprimerie Petter  Giesser   Held  Caroline  5  1919 .  pages 82 83    1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus   and the 90 Turkish travellers  men and women who were in it ordered   to descend. And there in the open street  under the eyes of their   husbands  fathers and brothers  the women without distinction of age   were violated  and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi  a native of Tripoli  and a   captain whose name is not known  and to whom the Hellenic authorities   had given safe conduct  were killed with specially atrocious tortures.   2. Before the battle  the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers  she was even stript   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the   following manner  Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt   end of a gun.   4. During the firing of the town  eleven children  six little girls   and five boys  fleeing from the flames  were stopped by Greek soldiers   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter  and thrown into a burning Jewish house   near bridge  where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.   5. The clock maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then   killed in the court of the Greek Church  but Ahmed Effendi has been   no more heard of.   6. At the market  during the fire  two unknown people were wounded   by bayonets  then bound together  thrown into the fire and burnt alive.   The Greeks killed also many Jews.

the usual,Organization  California Institute of Technology  PasadenaLines  30NNTP Posting Host  sandman.caltech.edukendall lds.loral.com  Colin Kendall 6842  writes  I just heard some anti gun control people giving the usual arguments  Its everyones right to bear arms  and the way to solve the problem of people getting killed by guns is better law enforcement. It strikes me that this argument could be logically extended as follows  A nuclear weapon is an  arm   hence anyone has a right to have  nuclear weapons. And if someone uses his nuclear weapons to blow up New York  L.A.  and Chicago  thats okay as long as we have a good police force capable of finding him and putting him in jail   which will serve as a deterrent to others. Do any anti gun control people disagree with this  and if so   why Yes  I am pro gun  and yes  I do disagree with this statement.Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactivedecay of plutonium and uranium  as well as the tritium in theweapon  tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things. Can you say  neutron flux     Plus these things have no self defense purposes.  Its kinda hard to justify their use asa militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use low yield weapons  or at worst for industrial target obliteration translation   cities and population centers .

Monophysites and Mike Walker,Organization  U of Wisconsin Madison College of EngineeringLines  127Hello src readers Again the misconception that Copts among other Oriental OrthodoxChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussionabout it a while ago. In article  May.6.00.34.58.1993.15426 geneva.rutgers.edu  db7n  andrew.cmu.edu  D. Andrew Byler  writes   The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism.  This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism  which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox. Then OFM comments      These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying different things its often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things  or whether they are using different terminology.  I dont think theres any question that there is a problem with Nestorius  and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical.  But Id like to be a bit wary about the Copts  Armenians  etc.  Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought. With my appreciation to the moderator  I believe that further elaborationis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issueof the Copt Net Newsletter  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople  as opposedto the western empire of Rome   the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria playedleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speakabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril  Pope of Alexandria  was the head of theEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was saidthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all theirtime in meetings. This leading role  however  did not fare well when politicsstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the EmperorMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.Dioscorus  the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled  to this interferencewas clear   You have nothing to do with the Church.   These political motivesbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451  when the Coptic  Church  wasunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches  who believed  inmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has onlyone nature  the divine  not two natures  the human as well as the divine.The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it wasportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon   In  that Council  monophysitism meantbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  Hisdivinity   and He   is perfect in  His humanity   but  His  divinity  and Hishumanity were united in one nature called  the nature of the incarnate word  which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts  thus  believe in twonatures  human  and    divine   that are   united in   one  without mingling without confusion  and without alteration   from the  declaration of faith atthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy .  These  two  natures  did not separatefor a moment or the twinkling of an eye   also from  the declaration of faithat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy .The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  ofChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly  but  theywanted to exile the  Church    to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian independent Pope. Despite  all of this   the Coptic Church  has remained verystrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from theWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusalto be politically influenced  or whether Pope Dioscurus  didnt  quite go theextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite  the CopticChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile  semantic  differences betweenall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117thsuccessor  of  St. Mark  Pope Shenouda III    To the  Coptic Church  faith ismore  important  than  anything  and   others  must know that  semantics  andterminology are of  little importance to us.   Throughout this  century   theCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. TheCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It hasremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  amember  of the all  African Council of Churches   AACC   and the  Middle EastCouncil of  Churches  MECC .  The Church    plays an  important role   in theChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  thetheological differences with the  Catholic  Greek Orthodox  Presbyterian  andEvangelical Churches. ... As a final note  the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did signa common statement of Christology  in which the heresey of Monophysitismwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe inMonophysitism.Peace Nabil          .                                                             .

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  AsAndrew Byler correctly stated it  the Nestorians and monophysites wereactually opposite parties.  The point I was making  which Nabilexplains in some detail  is that some groups that have been consideredheretical probably arent.Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups  the Alexandrians andAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptableto moderates in both camps  while ruling out the extremes.  I agreethat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the courseof the complex politics of the time  it appears that some people gotrejected who didnt intend heresy  but simply used language that wasnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to havejointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There aregroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  Thisposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are alsoa remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so calledmonophysites  there is reason to believe that the current so calledNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius fromwhat they saw as unfair treatment  but claim they did not adopt hisheresies  and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives ofthe Antiochene tradition.  clh

Well  Im not an Arab  but I think you  are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said.  The  bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is  very consistent with its policy of intimidation.

Revelations,Organization  Applied Presuppositionalism  Ltd.Lines  25phil.launchbury almac.co.uk  Phil Launchbury  writes    The  apostate church  of Revelation most likely refers to the 1st century   Jews who rejected their Messiah and had Him crucified.  John refers to them  Im afraid not. It refers to the church that Christ founded. Many  many  times he warns that the church will fall away into heresy as do the  apostles. For an example look at the parables in Matthew 13 31 33. They  refer to the kingdom of heaven  the church  and the process of how  they will be corrupted.Sorry  but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables isnonsense. I.e.   yeast    ALWAYS  stands for sin corruption heresy. For example beware  of the yeast of the Pharisees. ...Matthew 16 12 explains that by  leaven of the Pharisees  Jesus was simplyreferring to their teaching  not sin corruption heresy.Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said thatthe gates of hell would not prevail against His church.

Space FAQ 02 15   Network Resources,"Expires  6 May 1993 19 54 26 GMTOrganization  University of North Carolina  Chapel HillKeywords  Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes   net_730956391 cs.unc.edu NNTP Posting Host  mahler.cs.unc.eduLines  241Archive name  space netLast modified   Date  93 04 01 14 39 15  NETWORK RESOURCESOVERVIEW    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of    computers  so much of the material below may not apply to you. In    general  however  systems connected to the net fall in one of three    categories  Internet  Usenet  or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent    between these networks  and other resources available on one of these    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to    special servers.    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of    several mechanisms with  mostly  transparent connections between them.    One mechanism is the mailing list  in which mail is sent to a central    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In    addition to the general lists for space  called SPACE Digest for    Internet users  and SPACE on BITNET   there are a number of more    specialized mailing lists described below.    A second mechanism is Usenet netnews. This is somewhat like a bulletin    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a    group name. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are    called sci.space.news  sci.space  sci.space.shuttle  sci.astro     and talk.politics.space. Contributors post submissions  called    articles in netnews terminology  on their local machine  which sends    it to other nearby machines. Similarly  articles sent from nearby    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems  so    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was    posted.    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa  the other Usenet groups are not    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews  its more    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make    it the preferred option.MAILING LISTS    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list  and is now being run by the    International Space University  in only its second change of management    in over a decade .

Brendan McKay Clarifies the Nazi Racial Theory,"Organization  Cirrus Logic Inc.Lines  59Only Brendan McKay  or maybe ARF  would come to the rescue of Naziracial theory.  Is it distressing Brendan   The point is that anyeugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacksof pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias proposal cast the entire  problem as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst ofhis  even handed  solution of the Jewish Question  made it obvious what he had in mind  disolving the Jewish polity.  That  is  a Nazi doctrine rectification of the  abnormal presence  of the Jewish people within a larger body politic.  Whether your  solution  involves gas  monetary incentives to the poor Jews to marry out  or as Feisal Husseini has said   disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal surrounding Arab culture   you are engaged in a Nazi project.Just as obvious is your statement   I will not comment on the valueor lack of value of Eliass proposal.

The emergence of a considerable number of mixed   marriages in Israel Palestine  all of whom would have relatives on   both sides of the divide  would make the conflict lose its   ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a   truly civil society. The existence of a strong mixed stock of   people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the        Sounds just like a racial theory that Hitler outlined in Mein Kampf.  Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Eliass  proposal .  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Eliass idea  they were more like the opposite.    Nazis believed in racial purity  not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians  Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted  and in huge numbers murdered  because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but  mongrels  formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies  by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the  purist  Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten.  Brendan.  email   bdm cs.anu.edu.au "

AHL Season in review  off ice stuff ,"Organization  Clarkson UniversityLines  114Nntp Posting Host  craft.clarkson.eduX Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL8 Here is a review of some of the off ice things that haveaffected the AHL this year.ST JOHNS MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMSThe St Johns Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued byproblems. On ice  the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced theleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half ofthe seaosn  since mid Jan . They have played  home  games in placeslike Montreal  Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff  home games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax  NS. Onedemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs bus androcked it and broke windows in the St Johns Memorial Stadium.Despite the problems  Toronto officials insist that the Leafswill return to St Johns once the strike ends.                                                   SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only CanadianNHL team with an American AHL affiliate  and have made it clearthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian AtlanticProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office  but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership  rather than maintainingthe 56 year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.                                                  DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton  the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20 something to around a dozen  and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city.The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years ifthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold1400 for this year.                                                            SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIALThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city ofSaint John  NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansionfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.                                                         CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINEDespite rumors to the contrary  the Capitals will follow the BaltimoreSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps current farm team  the Baltimore Skipjacks announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announceda limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so playersincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.                                                      AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January  the AHL started a game of the week. The game  producedby  I believe  Pyman Productions  was televised across the CanadianMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games ofthe week  one in Canada and another in the US but since then  therehas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered andshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and  I believe  AtlanticSports Network in Canada  but Im not sure about that . I am notsure if playoff games will be covered.                                                     UTICA GONE  SYRACUSE ADDED There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around nextseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwesterncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.

Find  some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single  goal  might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person  appeared  to win.  And for those that didnt give up  I find something a little  scary  about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  Id  like to see as much a reward for co operation as for competition.   Lastly  about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was  an  English space magazine that had an on going discussion about moonbases  on  the cheap.

By editing thecolormap manually  copying from another icon that I didnt edit  I canfix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem  Thanks.

Idle questions for fellow atheists,Organization  University of Oulu  FinlandX Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL6 Lines  59acooper mac.cc.macalstr.edu wrote    I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of  the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group  of the population. Ive been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my tieswith Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority ofpeople  at least in Finland  seem to be apatheists   even though90   of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland religious people are actually a minority. Could it be possible that many people believe in god  just in case  It seems people do not want to seek the truth  they fall prey to PascalsWager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believereads the Bible regularly. The majority doesnt care   it believes but doesnt know what or how. People dont usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would saythat they are not  born in the Spirit   but this does not disturb them.Religion is not something to think about. Im afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossibledream. Religions have a strong appeal to people  nevertheless   a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that ourmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop  too manypeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow and unconsciously hope god wouldnt notice        Also  how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a  higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The  typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the  same inherent motivation  so one is not  intrinsically  different from the  other  qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn  somewhere  and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core   than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery  ie  how it  expresses its own selfishness.If logic and reason are valued  then I would claim that atheistic thinkingis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessaryassumptions they believe in   Ive yet to see good reasons to believein gods  or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.However  why do we value logic and reasoning  This questions bearssome resemblance to a long disputed problem in science  why mathematicsworks  Strong deep structuralists  like Atkins  have proposed thatperhaps  after all  everything _is_ mathematics.

Deuterocanonicals  esp  Sirach,"Organization  UH Dept of MathLines  53ddavis cass.ma02.bull.com  Dave Davis writes  	II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because 		they are not quoted by the NT authors.That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the bookof Enoch in the canon  as Dave noted .  One can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  Dave also writes III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because 		they teach doctrines contrary to the  uncontroverted  		parts of the canon.  	then I answer   		These is a logically invalid  a priori .  		Besides  we are talking about OT texts   		which in many parts are superceded by the NT 		 in the Xtian view . Would not this same 		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_  		This principle cannot be consistently applied. I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with onevoice  and he does not contradict himself.  The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspiredby the Spirit  i.e.  God breathed.  It is a test which is moreguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decidedthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test  even though some bookssuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example the Lutheran hymn  Now Thank We All Our God  quotes a passagefrom this book.The deutero canonical books were added much later in the churchshistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as therest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added thesebooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is wherethis sort of discussion ultimately ends.David H.

Twentyminutes later  when Jeffs color had paled to a flush  Mattypresented him with an estimate of  580 for a busted right mirrorand a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crackand masking the damaged area  not a new fairing.  Or he could buy thebike.Im not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortlyafterwards  to hook up with another piece of work  except that Mattytold me he ran the charge through in December and that it wentuncontested.

Statement to everyone on t p g,Organization  University of Illinois at Chicago  academic Computer Center  1993Apr19.201300.27080 CSD NewsHost.Stanford.EDU Lines  43In article  1993Apr19.201300.27080 CSD NewsHost.Stanford.EDU  andy SAIL.Stanford.EDU  Andy Freeman  says   Clue   Kratz position isnt a defense against inaccuracy.  I oppose gun control because it doesnt work.  If it did  Id support it.  In fact  I supported gun control before I did my homework.  Theres no demand for pro gun people who dont know what theyre talking about.  In fact  theyd be much better off if they didnt say anything. And why is this Freeman   Even if a pro gun person doesnt know what they aretalking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing ortwo.  I am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what I haveto say.  I have several good sources of material now that I know where to lookso calm down. Theres lots of information flowing on tpg for those interested in learning.  One can participate in those discussions without ranting inaccurately.  Failure to do so has consequences. Ah  Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning.  I have alsoasked several of the not so hostile folks on this group for sources ofinformation to read.  Do you think  Freeman  that maybe this means I aminterested in learning   I think it does because as you said people who dontknow anything wont be good for the pro gun cause. Another good habit to get into is to go read only for a while  to take the time to figure out how things work. Another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freemanand accept mistakes.  Sure  maybe it could have been some type ofmisinformation being slung by some anti gun nut but it wasnt.  I made mystatement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said dont worryabout it but also to learn as much as you can.  They accepted my mistake andgave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible.  I haveread several posts of yours and have found them informative.  Why dont yougive me the same chance   andyJason

After your post I looked in the  literature and located two articles that implicated corn  contains  tryptophan  and seizures. The idea is that corn in the diet might  potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder  not cause it.  Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. Id be interested.

We pumped her stomach and obtained what seemed like a couple of liters of corn  much of it intact kernals.   After a few hours she woke up and was fine.  I was tempted to sign her out as  acute corn intoxication.

the usual,"Organization  Iowa State University  Ames IADistribution  naLines  45arc cco.caltech.edu  Aaron Ray Clements  writes  I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials  i.e.  plutonium or reactor weapons grade uranium  one was required to obtain a federal permit to own such materials.	No  you merely have to start working on yellowcake or elsedevise a system to get it from other sources.  BTW  the DOE handlesreactor fuel  and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies thesereactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen hasnone of these official sources. Actually  why bother looking it up   From the material we covered last term  in 10 weeks  of Ge Ch 127  Nuclear Chemistry   I could  derive  what it would take to build a bomb.	Thats freshman level chemistry.  Big deal.  Can you make itwork   Thats PhD level physics.  Big difference.   And as far as the explosive charge  I  as a chemist  could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly available chemicals in the garage if I felt like.  The electronics  behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier  however . . . but not impossible using a few  tricks of the trade.  And if I really wanted to be nasty  I could include a core of  hydrogen and deuterium . . .	So you admit that theres no law that could stop you   Physicsaside  could you make one if you had the funds and time   The answeris yes.  So  do we lock you up now because of this   Surely you cansee where the comparison with anti gun laws comes into play here  Of course  the hardest part is getting the fissionable material to start with  and living long enough to put a bomb together.   Plutonium has some  nasty  properties . . . 	Precisely why its not as readily utilized as you seem to havebeen lead to believe.  BTW  98  U235 is far better for home made bombsthan trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation ofa device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.

I am not certain if thesenon linearities are  Gamma corrected  before encoding NTSC signalsor if the TV display is supposed to correct this. Also  if  256 grey levels  for example  are coded in a C program dothese intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PCmonitor  In other words does PC monitor display circuitrycorrect for  gamma errrors   Your response is much appreciated.

A WRENCH in the works ,"Disclaimer  This posting represents the posters views  not necessarily those of IBMNntp Posting Host  oslo.rchland.ibm.comOrganization  IBM RochesterLines  42From another space forum   NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS     When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS 56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250 000 foot altitude  then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media      Its been a long time since something like this happened.  Weve lost washers and bolts  before  but never a tool like this.     The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd.  Unfortunately  the workers supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its  extra payload .  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.    The free flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster  its 18 inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.  Rons ed. note   naaahhh   just too easy     A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take  appropriate action .  Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch._________________________________________________________Karl Anderson	DEV 2000  Configuration Management Version ControlDept 53K 006 2		Rochester  Minnesota 55901253 8044		Tie 8 453 8044INTERNET  karl vnet.ibm.comPRODIGY  CMMG96A To seek  to strive  to find  and not to yield.

Divorce,Organization  DSG  Stanford University  CA 94305  USALines  72I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce.  In article  May.7.01.10.03.1993.14583 athos.rutgers.edu  crs carson.u.washington.edu  Cliff Slaughterbeck  writes   Along the way  she was married  happily  to a wonderful and supportive husband and gave birth to two sons.  Still  everything was not perfect for Jane  since she could never open up the deepest part of her soul to her husband.  She always found that she could be much closer to her women friends than to her husband  as good and loing as a husband as he might be.  She struggled very much with this until at the age of 38  she decided that she was a lesbian.  When she came home to announce this  understanding of herself  her husband told her that he had come to the same understanding several years before and was waiting for her to come to that realization in her own time.  Her children ages 9 and 11 at the time were also extremely supportive of her.  As the youngest put it   that just  means that you love people very much.   Jane and her husband agreed to divorce but remain friends and still consider each other as part of the extended family to this day. One of the interesting things that Jane said in this whole discussion was  Homosexuality is not about what goes on in the bedroom.   She found that she was much more able to have a deep  committed relationship with a woman than a man.  Sex  in her mind  is only a part of the whole relationship. The key thing is how one interconnects with other people.  She made a specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man  since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years.   Take a few seconds and honestly ponder that thought and its implications    I have thought about the implications  and it is scary.  We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for thethrill of a younger  more attractive woman.  If we accept that it islegitimate for Jane to have divorced  how can we not accept anyonesdecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he canhave a more  deep  committed relationship. Marriage is not a state of being  it is a mutual journey in life.Love is not a passive feeling  it must be actively willed.Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because hecant be happy sexually unless he is with a beautifulyoung blonde   The real solution for both in the couple tomake a renewed effort.  Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared Hisrelation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband   Welearn something very deep and very mystical when we marry andremain faithful through times of trial.My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.If it were to resume growing  it is in remission  thanks be to God  then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexualrelations.  Thats life...the Lord would certainly not give mepermission to seek someone else to satisfy my  needs.   The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple  grows apart seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaningof marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hintof compromise.  We have become so petty and small minded thatsome husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless thewives lose weight I praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife.  She married meanyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness.And it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor  buthad I known I wouldnt have cared either.  And maybe Ill be ina car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down.A married couple should deal with these situations with the helpof the Lord  not divorce and run away from them.

An Anecdote about Islam,In Reply To   1pqfic 9s2 fido.asd.sgi.com Nntp Posting Host  127.0.0.1Organization  Kupajava  East of KrakatoaX Mailer  PSILink DOS  3.3 Lines  32 DATE    5 Apr 1993 23 32 28 GMT FROM    Jon Livesey  livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com   In article  114127 bu.edu   jaeger buphy.bu.edu  Gregg Jaeger  writes         I dont understand the point of this petty sarcasm. It is a basic     principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says  I testify    that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God  that     so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one _must_    be considered muslim by all muslims. So the phenomenon youre attempting    to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic    Islamic principles. If you want to attack Islam you could do better than    than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts.  Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing bad acts  people temporarily become atheists   jon.Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defendingIslam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticizeyou.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using  petty sarcasm .  SoB.M. can have his  temporary atheists  whenever he needs them and all the temporary atheists  can later say that they were always good Muslims becausethey never explicitly rejected Islam.  Temporary atheism  temporary Islam  temporary marriage.  None of it sticks.  A teflon religion.  How convenient.  And so easy to clean up after.  But then  what would you expect from a bunch of people who cant even agree on the phases of the moon

KS Do you think that the motto points out that this country is proud KS of its freedom of religion  and that this is something that KS distinguishes us from many other countries  MW No. KS Well  your opinion is not shared by most people  I gather. Perhaps not  but that is because those seeking to make government recognize Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do not think they are infringing on the rights of others who do not share their beliefs.Yes  but also many people who are not trying to make government recognizeChristianity as the dominant religion in this country do no thinkthe motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share theirbeliefs.And actually  I think that the government already does recognize thatChristianity is the dominant religion in this country.  I mean  it is.Dont you realize recognize this This isnt to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings ofChristianity  just that most people do. Like Ive said before I personally dont think the motto is a major concern.If you agree with me  then what are we discussing  KS Since most people dont seem to associate Christmas with Jesus much KS anymore  I dont see what the problem is. Can you prove your assertion that most people in the U.S. dont associate Christmas with Jesus anymore No  but I hear quite a bit about Christmas  and little if anything aboutJesus.  Wouldnt this figure be more prominent if the holiday were reallyassociated to a high degree with him   Or are you saying that theassociation with Jesus is on a personal level  and that everyone thinksabout it but just never talks about it That is  can  you  prove that most people  do  associate Christmasmost importantly with Jesus  Anyways  the point again is that there are people who do associate Christmas with Jesus.

I would expect this kind of behaviorfrom the Evangelical Born Again Gospel Thumping In Your Face Were The Only True Christian Protestants  but I have always thought that Catholics behaved better than this.Friend Dennis  I urge you to follow the example of your fellowCatholics  of who I count many dozens as my friends  and practiceyour faith through good example and decent living and respectfor the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to thelevel of the E B A G T I Y F W T O T C Protestants  who thinkthat the best way to witness is to be strident  intrusive  loud insulting and overbearingly self righteous.The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated  get it  Middle East   date palms   oh  never mind  but apparently acceptable  on a steaminess level  to be accepted as part of the canon. Fromthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible withCatholic doctrine.Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica  Not necessarily a lovestory between people of that faith  but a love story that is notexploitative  does not seek redemption through penis size  paysproper respect to the dignity of each partner  and is still eroticenough to have a place on a.s.s.I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify  alsomost of the _Journal Entries_  and _Rings I and II_.I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography andincrease the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all ofthe  Ive got an enormous dick  and I shot my wad all over her face stories are crap.

That was the bronze medal game in the SM liiga which Tichonovs team Porin Assat  the Aces of town Pori  lost.  Vasili  the son of Victor Tichonov  the famous Soviet coach  said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him totake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach whereever he goes. He definitely wont be coaching Assat anymore  afterthree  seasons . I dont know why.Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team  produced manyplayers to our national team. Assat wasnt a skilled team  IMHO  butthey had the fighting spirit. After all  they butchered Jokerit in theplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS  the champs. But Assat wasntconsistent  only when they were in the right mood they could beat anyteam in the SM liiga.I am not 100  sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said  he wantsto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate anddecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach butmaybe theyll do some compromise.Could somebody post more information about Vasili  I know he was coachingin the former Soviet league  teams  results  His character as a coach "

In order of your questions  I oppose it  I oppose it  I oppose it and Huh   Wha   Where did _that_ topic come from and whats it got to dowith the discussion at hand     When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimesagainst different classes of people  and yes  I do consider laws whichallow mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon theconvicts attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fitinto that category   the category of classes I had in mind was that ofthe standard civil rights discussion    classes based upon race  gender ethnicity  religion  sexual orientation  etc.  Having you ask aboutclasses based upon ones _profession_ rather than ones personalcharacteristics caught me off guard  and I had to think out the questionfrom scratch.What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize suchclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declaresome people to be of more worth than others  and that would be anathemato the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.Last year  when a federal crime bill was under consideration which wouldhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty pluscrimes  including the murder of various federal officers hitherto notprotected by that  aura of deterrence   critics pointed out theabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for themurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of acivilian teacher  when the latter  arguably  provided a much morevalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.This was an emotionally compelling argument  but even the proponents ofthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judgesome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their contribution to society.   I view that doctrine as being both  a personally repugnant and  b  repugnant to the Equal Protection clause ofthe 14th Amendment.Accordingly  I believe that there should be no laws which give anyprofession based class of people special protection  via the mechanismof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members ofthat class   not even police officers  federal officers or high rankingmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

Many of these studies are  discussed in  Inflammatory Bowel Disease   MacDermott  Stenson. 1992.     But if I recall correctly  there were some methodological bones to be  picked with the studies  both the ones w pos. and w neg. results . In  the studies patients were given EPA  a few grams day for most of the  studies   but  if I recall correctly  there was no restriction of the  _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed  laypersons perspective  this seems mistaken. If lots of n 6 FAs are  consumed along with the EPA  then the ratio of  bad  prostanoid  products to  good  prostanoid products could still be fairly  bad.   Isnt this ratio the issue     Whats the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days  EPA  supplements  along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs  appear to have helped me significantly  though it could just be the  low absolute amount of fat I eat    8 10  calories .     Brian  bmdelane midway.uchicago.edu As you note  the research is mixed  so there is no consensus on therole of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis.  There is a role for shortchain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouchesthat are inflammed  Short is butyrate and shorter .  There may be a rolefor treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids  and I am looking forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people aredoing.  You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of otherfatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that oreven write a letter to the editor   it is a good point.  By the way the abbreviation EPA is not in general use  so I do not know what fatty acid you are speaking about.And to Brian an U of C      There is a physician named Stephen Hanauerthere who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You might give him a call.  He is interested in new combinations of drugs for the treatment of IBD.  If you call please say hello to him from me I was looking at U of C for a position  and perhaps still am.  Andbe sure to look into joining the CCFA.Best of Luck.Steve Holland

Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that deniesthem their right of SELF DETERMINATION. period.   I know. I was just pointing out that not compromising may be a bad idea. And   there are  in Israel  voices against negotiations. And I think there are many   among palestineans also against any negociations.       Just an opinion     DorinOk. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those whohave the right for it.As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against thecurrent negotiations and the so called peace process  theyare not against peace per se  but rather for their well founded predictionsthat Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank  and most probably the samefor Golan Heights  back to the Arabs. An 18 months of  negotiations  in Madrid and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying whyare you blaming israelis for no result negotiations.I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations  what do they have toloose  Arabs feel that the current  negotiations  is ONLY for legitimizing the currentstatus quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and oranges . That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked. Just an opinion.Hasan

From Page 10  .. and in 1946  when the National Health Service was established  homeopathy was included as an officially approved method of treatment.I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946 then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists inthe employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authoritiesrefused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allowschiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but Ive never seen onethere and I dont know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.There are a lot of Britons on the net  so someone should be able totell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.

I disagree completely. Until rather recently  most people did not    believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb. Popular    opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact.   True  but nevertheless the basis of all  matters of fact  is overwhelming   popular opinion  and some overwhelming popular opinion  is  fact   the   sun shines  .  If it were not so  physics would be a personal matter    assumed to be different for each of us.  There would be YourGravity and   MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict   both.    This is simply complete nonsense. The basis for matters of fact is   if any class of opinion  the majority of INFORMED popular opinion  for some value of informed. I would really hate to base my knowledge  of  for instance  QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is. The  basis   Eric  is people peering at the world and saying what they see.  Im talking about uninterpreted facts   observations.  _People_ do those.  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory that is more than personal.Yes  thats true  but you have to be clear exactly what isan uninterpreted observation. Its pretty low level stuff.The sun shines is already a LOT higher level than that. Wecan agree that I perceive brightness perhaps.   Now I take an experience of good evil to be every bit as raw a fact as an   experience of pain  or vision.  That might seem like a good first pass guess  but it turns out to  be a pretty cruddy way to look at things  because we all seem to  have rather different opinions  experiences  about what is good  and evil  while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says. Youre not comparing apples with apples.  If we all look at the same meter  well agree.  If were all in the same situation  thats when well agree on fundamental values  if at all.  People who say that nobody agrees on values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either.Huh  What do you mean all in the same situation  Lets take meand Dennis Kriz as examples. Were in pretty different situations but I think we can agree as to whether its day or night. I dontthink we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morallyacceptable. Yet we are certainly in the same difference ofsituations with respect to each other. Looks like weasel wordsto me  Frank.   I dont see that its any evidence at all.  As I point out above  Im really not interested very much in  what the popular opinion is. Im prepared to trust  to some extent    the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation  because by and large they accord with my own. However  if everyone  else said the dial read 1.5 and it looked like a 3 to me  I would  hope that I would believe myself. I.e. believing other people about  these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting  what I would believe if I observed myself  but the possibility exists  that it is not. Since I know from observation that others disagree  with me about what is good  I believe I can discount popular opinion  about good from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion.  I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get  people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations  is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus  actually. Firstly  if everyone else said the dial was 1.5 and I saw 3  Id check my lens prescription.Thats up to you  I guess.   Secondly  your observation that people disagree shows nothing   people may be looking at different things  by virtue of being in different situations.  If I look at an elephant  Ill  see an elephant.  That doesnt imply that you will see an elephant if you  look at an iguana.This different situations stuff is pretty confusing  Frank. Howdo we decide if we are in the same situation  You mind explaining      Thirdly  I question your assumption that when people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals  that  they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals  that seems to be the  disagreement you refer to .Huh  I dont think so. I think that people disagree aboutfundamental goals. Ekr   Eric Rescorla                                     ekr eitech.com             Would you buy used code from this man

When Israeli security personnel beat Arab prisoners the wayChicago police do   then  you have a right to complain. Since it does NOTpractice physical torture in any way  kindly refrain from using this word.Joshbackon VMS.HUJI.AC.IL   Title of article  Moderate physical pressure   Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation  room in Tulkarm prison  during which he says he was humiliated   beaten and tortured  Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator  a  Shabak agent Captain Louis  chatting on the phone with his wife.   At those moments   Omar said   I felt that he was like a  humanbeing  but right after he finished talking  he would be beat  me and say  You listened to the conversation and enjoyed  yourself and I understood that he was not really a human being .   In late October 1992  after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm  prison  Omar Jaber was released without charges.  Among the Jews   as among the Arabs  there are good people and bad people   he said  after his release   but there  in Tulkarm  in the interrogations  rooms  you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that  he is a human being . Although he left the detention installation  in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated   I sat at home for ten days. My  hands shook from nerves    one may consider Omar Jaber lucky  He  got out  not so healthy  but entire  and even ultimately returned  to normal functioning  at the small solar heater plant he owns.   In contrast  Hassan Bader al Zbeidi  for example  was released  seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the  Shabak wing  cut off from his surroundings. He doesnt speak or  react. Mustafa Barakat  aged only 23  who was arrested in early  August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation  left  it one day later   dead.  We have recently received an especially  large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at  the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators   noted  Dr. Niv Gordon  director of the Association of Israel and  Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights.  ...    The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan  Saber Makhlouf  a 20 year old student. In fact  he was extremely  fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated  in Tulkarm prison  in case the publication in the paper would  return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.    ...follow description of tortures....    Omar  a tall bearded man  was silent.  I do not want to talk about  it   he finally said  quietly. Some time later  embarrased and  ashamed  he spoke   Sometimes he beats you and beats you until  youll kiss his hand  and not only his hand. Even the hands of  another interrogator  and another  whom he calls into the room   and the last interrogator says   Now you are kissing my hand  and  later if I want  you will kiss my ass.    These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation   located within the military government compound in Tulkarm  West  Bank . But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In  early March the IDF allowed representatives of BTselem  the  Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories  to  visit Tulkarm prison  but denied them access to the interrogation  wing.  The interrogation wing is Shabak property  being solely  under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by  it   said Lieutnant Sharon Shoan  the commander of the  installation  according to the internal report written by Btselem  member  Yuval Ginbar  following the visit. Major David Peer   governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command   was quoted in the report    There is an ethical problem here   no  one can enter the interrogation wing .

I hadnt bought a newcar since I bought my Honda 4WD back in 85  and I was unbelieveably offended bymost salespeople I met.Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer whereI bought my car  and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after salessupport  and the fixed pricing made it  very  easy for me to decide exactly whatI wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at thedealer. Hes been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn  based onwhat hes seen and heard from his customers. Saturn also has a good extended warranty program   675 for 6 year 60K miles  fully refunded if you dont use it. That works out to an actual cost of  170 orso  based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates its morelike  120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during anywarranty work  without counting against the refund.  mike

What kind of transmission would be reliable underwater  in murky or even night time conditions   Im not sure if sound is feasible given the distortion under  water...obviously direction would have to be accurate but range could be relatively short  I imagine 2 or 3  hundred yards would be more than enough   Jim McDonaldRefer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS 958 829  1 220 005  1 322 622  1 349 103  1 315 862  1 349 104 1 303 729  1 303 730  1 316 188He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.For a review  refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_  March 1919 and June 1919.Rogers methods were used extensively during the World War  and wasunclassified after the war. Supposedly  the government rethought thissoon after  and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF oftheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space isquickly dissapated  by the square of the distance   but that whichtravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore the published data showed that when noise drowned out regularreception  the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise free.IF you find this hard to believe  then refer to the work of theman who INVENTED wireless  Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers methodswere correct  while Hertzian wave theory was completely  abberant .     ET    Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes.

Tickets   advice is worth what you paid,Organization  Apple Computer  Inc.  Cupertino  CaliforniaLines  28Distribution  caI cant think of another subject that generates as much contradictoryadvice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybodys got anopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information isextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesnt know.  Cops dontknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesnt know.  The vehicle codeonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in awide variety of ways.  And the public at large   I seldom hear anyadvice that doesnt disagree with something Ive experienced.If you dont believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code study it  and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what reallyhappens.  Read  Fight Your Ticket  too  but dont miss the littlesection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and yourebasically screwed.As you may have guessed  Im pretty down on the system here inCalifornia.  Ive carefully prepared for court  bringing witnesses andrevealing serious holes in the officers story  only to be slapped withthe maximum allowable fine  plus assessments of over 100     themessage clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public tryinghis own cases.So heres my advice when you find yourself with a ticket   Take trafficschool if you can.  If its a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyercan present the exact same case as you  the difference is thesentence.   Paul Thompson    Apple Computer

By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season   obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh  well.Roberts was long gone    he was probably an Oriole in 1964.

However  youmay be speaking of  Public Missle  Inc.   which is a legitimate companythat has been around for a while.Due to advances in composite fuels  engines are now available for modelrockets using similar composites to SRB fuel  roughly 3 times more powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadableform  i.e. aluminum casing  end casings  o rings    .  The engines rangefrom D all the way to M in common manufacture  N and O Ive heard ofused at special occasions.To be a model rocket  however  the rocket cant contain any metal structural parts  amongst other requirements.  Ive never heard of amodel rocket doing 50 000.  I have heard of   20 000 foot flights.These require FAA waivers  of course  .  There are a few large nationallaunches  LDRS  FireBALLS   at which you can see many   K sized engineflights.  Actually  using a   G engine constitutes the area of  HighPower Rocketry   which is seperate from normal model rocketry.  Purchaseof engines like I have been describing require membership in the NationalAssociation of Rocketry  the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc.  or you have tobe part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.Amatuer rocketry is another area.  Im not really familiar with this but it is an area where metal parts are allowed  along with liquid fuelsand what not.

Mr. Richardsons position  I believe  isa healthy one  and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try toflame and destroy NT  if it ever shows up  wanting instead everything to befree  and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards.It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.Mrs. Henne

Gianchandani  writes    Mubashir Cheema           Dont buy one  that is the best way to avoid tickets         I used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over  see        the thing  give me a ticket.  One time my sister was driving         and had it in the glove compartment  it was broken  and she        got a ticket.  In 1987  I had received 4 tickets because of        it  one for my sister  so a total of five .          That was five years ago  now I dont have one and Have not        gotten a ticket.  My driving habits have not changed        drastically.  Only two days ago I was going 77 MPH on Highway        with 55 MPH limit  cop saw me  I break a little  nothing        happened  I was driving a Mini Van  with my family in it .        Otherwise  I have Cutlass Supreme   which I do 70 most of the        times on the highway.          So basically my opnion is not to get one  if you do get pulled        over  The cop will hear your excuse  but if you have a radar        detecter  he will NOT.  again  this has been my experienc   Just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop.  But  be sure to get front AND rear sensors... You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the copdoesnt see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far  as statedby Car and Driver  and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from. It also gives the amount of  threats  it is picking up  so if you go through the same place everyday  and it always goes off there  you can glance at the number of  threats  the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.  Its about  300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.                                            Rob Fusi                                            rwf2 lehigh.edu

Ban All Firearms  ,Organization  The Santa Cruz Operation  Inc.Lines  34jrm gnv.ifas.ufl.edu    Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar pound area.  It would not   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.   High ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such  but   the average person  and average thug  would be lucky to get a zip gun     and would pay through the nose for it.Good point you make.  However  a zip gun  by definition  is a crude homemade gun  certainly not something capable of sustained  accuratefire  but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recallthe tiny  single shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II foruse by partisans.  They were essentially well made zipguns  incapable ofeffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means ofkilling German soldiers for their guns.Also note that the crowd pleasin favorite  the Sten gun  wasspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.The points been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steeltubing  hand tools and a welder.I still think that while the point is good  I think theres a differencebetween marijuana and firearms  in that quality marijuana can be grownlocally  theres no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned  Ithink the demand for  real  guns will be sufficient to make smugglingeconomically feasible  thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case  theresult would be the same  people who arent criminals wont havefirearms  and  bad guys  will continue to have access to them  one wayor another.  And I dont see that as a necessary situation.   Allan J. Heim   allanh sco.COM   ... uunet sco allanh    1 408 427 7813

The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger   icon  or use the Debugger option in the Run command   and the   debugger application goes to VGA character mode  as it is designed   to do . The screen goes haywire  and is largely unreadable. The   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.   Through trial and error  I have found that when the disrupted screen   is displayed you should do  Alt Spacebar  followed by the letter    R . This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen  and it   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didnt have to do this.   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles   the VGA mode.      The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use   another monitor in place of my usual one.I still like this video card  and am hoping its problems will beremedied  they do offer a 5 year warranty .   swh  20apr93

You have completely missed the point with the Selke trophy.  It goes  to the best defensive forward.  This is the forward who forgoes points  to help his team out defensively.  It is an unsung hero of sorts.  Yes   Lemieux and Gilmour are good defensive players  but they play a more  offensively oriented style than a true defensive forward.  This year   You mean guys that check but cant score   The guys who can both check and score shouldnt be candidates   Is that right The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goalsfrom being scored  not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play theirnumber one purpose is to score  defence is secondary  especially consideringthe line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  That iswhy they are not Selke candidates.  2. When Tarasov called Bob Gainey the best player in the world  it was  assumed that he meaned the best _technical_ player  the one who knew  every intricacy about playing hockey and never made a technical error.  And who was it that made this assumption   All of your friends maybe  Sorry Greg  but 2 people arent enough...you can  assume  all that you want to  but if you think Tarasov was serious then you are an idiot.Someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation it was a few months ago .  Whoever this was please repost it.  I agree with this assessment.  Bob Gainey may have been the best technical  player ever.  Right Greg.  Did you see this in the Sun or something   What did you think of Claude Provost   Gainey was nothing more than a journeyman player whos outstanding abilities were entirely political.  He might have had a col  lection of defensive skills but he had absolutely no offensive skills at all.  None.  But perhaps you think that the abilities to pass the puck  shoot the puck and deke a goalie or defenseman are not technical skills   Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did youever watch him play  He never made a technical error. Babbling deleted  Gee Greg  the pundits were calling Gilmour the best two way player in the league way back when he was with St. Louis.  I would have expected you to have picked up on that. Who are these pundits    Gilmour was good with St Louis  but he was not thebest two way player in the game when he was with them.  You have overhypedGilmour on this net for months.  He is a very good forward  but hardly thebest in the NHL.Gregmeister

NowSP  after this second episode  so similar in nature to the first  evenSP  he is scratching his head.Theres no data that sugar coated cereals cause seizures.  I haventeven seen anything anecdotal on it.  Given how common they are eaten  do you know any child or adolescent who  doesnt  eat the stuff   I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now.Also  theres nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brainis concerned  except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such asgalactosemia   sugar is sugar  regardless if it is coated on cereal sprinkled onto cereal  or dissolved in soda  coffee or whatever.There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame loweringseizure thresholds  but I dont believe anything ever came of it.    .

Need help with video detection circuit,Organization  SystemsnSoftwareLines  55I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video  Vs.a blank screen  by monitoring the R G  and B outputs of a graphicscard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at65 MHz  which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also beable to tell the difference between a blank screen  about 300 mv and a dim screen  say  around 310 mv .  Oh yes  it also needs to becheap.  My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators  eachcompariator had the   input going to one of the guns  the   inputwent to a reference created by a voltage divider a potentiometer .The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. Ineeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire thecompariators  so I could have a whole screen full of text  but mycircuit would not detect it.   The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference thenthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  Infact the difference between completely black and completely white isonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify thevideo signals to make this work.  There are faster compariators  but they are expensive  and require split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariatorwith three 1.89 compariators  and create a whole new power supplycircuit.  At this point  I think what I need is some sort of transistorcircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...Unfortunately  I am way out of my league when It comes to designingtransistor circuits  so I am appealing to the net for help.  Anyideas  tips  circuits  pointers  references  etc. would be greatlyappreciated.  Oh yes  I only sample the output of this thing every second or so  soI dont need a fast response time at all  however  I havent found away to take advantage of that fact.Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give.

Infield Fly Rule,Organization  NETCOM On line Communication Services  408 241 9760 guest Lines  31jrogoff scott.skidmore.edu  jay rogoff  writes  One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed.  I believe the rule also does  not  deal with this situation  If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught  runners can tag up and advance at their own risk  as on any fly ball. However  if the Infield Fly is  not  caught  at what point can a runner legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early   When the ball hits the ground   When a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground  Enlightenment would be appreciated.Im not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from beingforced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Otherthan that  isnt it just the same as any situation in which a runner ona base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball  That is if the ball is caught he can tag up and run  or decide to stay   andif the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

When are two people married in Gods eyes ,"Organization  AT TLines  69In article  Apr.23.02.55.25.1993.3117 geneva.rutgers.edu   rjs2 po.cwru.edu  Richard J. Szanto  writes   In a previous article  randerso acad1.sahs.uth.tmc.edu  Robert Anderson  says      I would like to get your opinions on this  when exactly does an engaged   couple become  married  in Gods eyes   Some say that if the two have   publically announced their plans to marry  have made their vows to God  and   are unswervingly committed to one another  I realize this is a subjective   qualifier  they are married joined in Gods sight.    I have discussed this with my girlfriend often.  I consider myself married   though legally I am not.  Neither of us have been with other people sexually   although we have been with each other.  We did not have sexual relations  until we decided to marry eventually.  For financial and distance reasons   we will not be legally married for another year and a half.  Until then   I consider myself married for life in Gods eyes.  I have faith that we  have a strong relationship  and have had for over 4 years  and will be  full of joy when we marry in a church.  First  however  we must find a  church  we will be living in a new area when we marry  and will need to  find a new church community .    Anyway  I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God  they are  married and are bound by that commitment.         						 Rick SzantoRick has nailed the problem down pretty well.As I can find no Scripture  have I missed it    that detailswhen you are married  I have to make some assumptions basedon the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.  It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage husband to be  wife to be  and God.  If you promise beforeeach other and God that you will convenant together to bemarried  then...you are  IMO .So why do we have the ceremonial part    That seems to bethere for  connectedness  in the Body of Christ.  My brothersand sisters ought to be involved so that there can be someaccountability on both our parts.  Thats part of the conceptfrom Hebrews about  not forsaking the assembling of yourselvestogether as is the custom of some.   We need each other becauseLone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of aself sufficiency that the I dont see in the NT.  Does anyonesee the Paul Simon  I am a rock  I am an island...  model anywherein Christianity.  Song lyrics show your age        Further  since marriage is a legal matter institution in the USAand many other places  and such laws do not specifically gocrosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture  we ought toobey them to avoid even the appearance of  evil   I Thess 5 22 So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the conscience of others because back to the beginning...you aremarried when you and your intended promise each other and Godto be in convenant.  IMO What chall think  Bobby   akgua rjb In some states  the kind of commitment described in Richard Szantosposting can create a common law marriage.  Indeed his posting itselfmight go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists should the issue ever end up in court.  He might want to consult alawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state.    clh "

Q3   Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG   Note  I do      not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy      of W4WG for each of our machines  it is just that I would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies. 	Not that I know of  I bought two copies  had some problems with one	installed both from the same copie  no problems. Do worry I just had	a really old BIOS and thats the only problem I got.  Q4   If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace      all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current      Win 3.1 files 	It will replace all older files  I think  and prompt you for the	others.  Q5   If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out  will I have      any troubles with the W4WG machines 	This I do not know...  When I started this message  I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried away. Ill stop now    .  I look forward to your replies.  Al					Hope this helps					GEL"

When the Palestinian on Palestiniancivil war stops and all Palestinians can behave like mature human beings Israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. Not before.

Jim Jordan says  The precedent was set by the WHA in their first season.  They used a red puck for exhibition games and a blue one for the regular season. Thankfully  they abandoned it in favour of black before the next season began.

Newspapers censoring gun advertisements,Organization  U.C. BerkeleyLines  24NNTP Posting Host  koala.berkeley.eduI dont know what Traders is claiming  but it appears to me thatthe Oakland Tribune has censored gun ads in the past.  Likewisefor the San Francisco Chronicle  and I have never seen a gunad in the San Francisco Examiner.Specifically  about a year ago on Thursdays  when Traders placedits ads  the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representingany handgun sale  though text could list it.  The Trib. wouldrun a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Tradersad at all.Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noiseabout measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Tradersad  then started publishing it  but without any handgun graphic  thenstopped  then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago ithas not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non ad interludesa Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take theirads.Yes  the usual Chron.

As soon as you possibly can.  Thedifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recoveryand a long  drawn out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now  your garden varietydoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists inthese kinds of problems.  DONT WAIT  THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.The remainder of this information is paraphrased  without permission  froma wonderful report by New Zealands Department of Labour  OccupationalSafety and Health Service    Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment andRehabilitation  A Practitioners Guide .First  a glossary  or  fancy names for how you shouldnt have your hands   note  youre likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors     RSI  Repetitive Strain Injury   a general term for many kinds of injuries  OOS  Occupational Overuse Syndrome    synonym for RSI  CTD  Cumulative Trauma Disorder    another synonym for RSI  WRULD  Work Related Upper Limb Disorders    yet another synonym for RSI  CTS  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  see below   Hyperextension   Marked bending at a joint.  Pronation  Turning the palm down.  Wrist extension  Bending the wrist up.  Supination  Turning the palm up.  Wrist flexion  Bending the wrist down.  Pinch grip  The grip used for a pencil.  Ulnar deviation  Bending the wrist towards the little finger.  Power grip  The grip used for a hammer.  Radial Deviation  Bending the wrist toward the thumb.  Abduction  Moving away from the body.  Overspanning  Opening the fingers out wide.Now then  problems come in two main types  Local conditions and diffuseconditions.  Local problems are what youd expect  specific muscles tendons  tendon sheaths  nerves  etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.Diffuse conditions  often mistaken for local problems  can involve musclediscomfort  pain  burning and or tingling  with identifiable areas oftenderness in muscles  although theyre not necessarily  the problem.     Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur   Heres the theory.Normally  your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whichpass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle  you restrictthe blood flow.  By the time youre exerting 50  of your full power youre completely restricting your blood flow.Without fresh blood  your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic  without oxygen  metabolism  which generatesnasty by products like lactic acid  which cause pain.Once one muscle hurts  all its neighbors tense up  perhaps to relieve theload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury  but it only makesthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues.Another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness fromyour nerves.  They need blood too.Anyway  when youre typing too much  youre never really giving a changefor the blood to get back where it belongs  because your muscles neverrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress  poor posture  and poorergonomics  only make things worse.    Specific injuries you may have heard of  note  most injuries come in two flavors  acute and chronic.  Acuteinjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions haveless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real. Tenosynovitis    an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitisoccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent  not enough tocause acute inflamation  but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths abilityto lubricate the tendon.  As a result  the tendon sheath thickens  getsinflamed  and youve got your problem.Tendonitis    an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendoncan cause inflamation.  Eventually  the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break  leaving behind debris which induces more friction  moreswelling  and more pain.   Sub acute  tendonitis is more common  which entailsa dull ache over the wrist and forearm  some tenderness  and it gets worsewith repetitive activity.Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    the nerves that run through your wrist into yourfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms includefeeling  pins and needles   tingling  numbness  and even loss of sensation.CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.Adverse Mechanical Tension    also known as neural tension  this is wherethe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblycompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy .Others  for just about every part of your body  theres a fancy name fora way to injure it.  By now  you should be getting an idea of how OOSconditions occur and why.  Just be careful  many inexperienced doctorsmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  when in reality  youmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinionbefore somebody does something drastic to you  like surgery .  4   Typing posture  ergonomics  prevention  treatmentThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reducetension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.If youre under a load of stress  this is doubly important.  Tune outthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guidingprinciple in your work  every three minutes take a three second break.EVERY THREE MINUTES  TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really  do it everythree minutes.  Its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down  and relax.If you cant sleep  you really need to focus on this.  Rest  sleep  andrelaxation are really a big deal.There are all kinds of other treatments  of course.  Drugs can reduceinflamation and pain.  Custom molded splints can forcefully prevent badposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthenyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good postureand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot coldcontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say whats bestfor you.    Posture    here are some basic guidelines.   I so liked the way this waswritten in the New Zealand book that Im lifting it almost verbatim fromAppendix 10.    dwallach . Let your shoulders relax.. Let your elbows swing free.. Keep your wrists straight.. Pull your chin in to look down   dont flop your head forward.. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.. Try leaning back in the chair.. Dont slouch or slump forward.. Alter your posture from time to time.. Every 20 minutes  get up and bend your spine backward.Set the seat height  first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much.Now  draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortableto work at.  If you are short  this may be impossible.  The beest remedyis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using afootrest.Now  adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacebetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you inthe hollow of your back  so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thisarea.If you operate a keyboard  you will be able to spend more time leaningback  so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest  if available. Now  I diverge a little from the text A good chair makes a big difference.  If you dont like your chair  gofind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height  back angle back height  and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get inthe way  although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable armrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a goodstore and play with all these chairs    pick one thats right for you.In the San Francisco Bay Area  I highly recommend  Just Chairs.   Thename says it all.    Keyboard drawers  wrist pads  and keyboard replacements There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For somepeople  wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However  with good posture  youshouldnt be resting your wrists on anything    you would prefer yourkeyboard to be  right there .  If you drop your arms at your side and thenlift your hands up at the elbow  you want your keyboard under your handswhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course  you want to avoidpronation  wrist extension  and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist padsmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come andlook at how you work  how you sit  how you type  and how you relax.  Itsoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders ordeviated hands.Some argue that the normal  flat keyboard is antiquated and poorlydesigned.  A number of replacements are available  on the market  today.Check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail.  5   Requests for more infoClearly  the above information is incomplete.

I suppose it must have died out since 1946   then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in  the employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities  refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows  chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but Ive never seen one  there and I dont know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.  There are a lot of Britons on the net  so someone should be able to  tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.                                                                                       I dont think they provide homeopaths  heck the heir apparent was trying to promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It pleased my family no end  since Im at an Osteopathic school  sort of validated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the practice was different....oh.	If youre seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of the national health service adopting it  I suggest that you are not very sure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946  the NHS was still having its nurses taught the fine art of  cupping   which is the vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup  placing it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.

Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc 3   which will not return  memory to the OS  ie. the X server might  free 3   a Pixmap  but the heap does  not shrink .  One disadvantage of the MIT SHM is that  in its sample implementation   there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments  if the client dies a sudden  violent death  e.g.   kill  .  You have to   be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.   Well  part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around  that problem. First  I create the shared memory segment  attach the client   attach the X server  and then remove     the segment. If you read the man  pages on removing of shared memory segments  you will see that the segment  only dies after all attachments are gone.  Now  if the client dies  thats one attachment gone  the OS cleans up for you   and since the X server notices the client has dies  frees up its resources   including detaching from the segment  there goes the last attachment. No more  shared memory segment.  Terrible  but it works.				Regards 					Richard Gooch...."

Since you have referred to the Messiah  I assume you are referring         to the New Testament.  Please detail your complaints or e mail if         you dont want to post.  First century Greek is well known and         well understood.  Have you considered Josephus  the Jewish Historian          who also wrote of Jesus   In addition  the four gospel accounts         are very much in harmony.  Bill  I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider theJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I meanan expert who  in the course of his or her research  is willing to let thechips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists  who may otherwise bedefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They arenot trustworthy by scholarly standards  and others .Why an insert   Read it   I have  a number of times.  The passage is glaringlyout of context  and Josephus  a superb writer  had no such problem elsewhere in his work.  The passage has  nothing  to do with the subject matter in which it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong aboutthe Josephus insert  your  proof  is meaningless and it should not be repeatedhere.  Whats more  even if Josephus happened to be legitimate  it would  prove nothing.  Scholars speak of the  weight of evidence.   Far more independentevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming  yourbelief is based on faith.  Thats OK  but you exceed your rights when you passfaith off as fact.As for the gospels  there are parallels  but there are also glaringinconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldnt a perfect canon be perfect  Shouldnt there be absolutely no room for debate   I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms  and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox  for Herb Huston  no known kinship or familial relationship  but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry .The fact that there are inconsistencies  gaps and contradictions does not denyyour position.  On the other hand  neither do the gospels  prove  your faith. Independent evidence is necessary  and I know of none  which we have alreadydiscussed  and so far you have not provided any .  Until then  its faith. Moreover  you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attemptedto  prove  your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different thansaying  I am right because I say so.   Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals  this is where fundamentalist  came from  of orthodox Protestant Christianity  to wit  1 Jesus performed miracles  2  Jesus was born of a virgin  3  Jesus was bodilyresurrected  4  Jesus crucifixion atoned for human sin  and   here is theclincher   5  the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe inerrant  broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take thefirst four as literally true  and then validate them with a literally inerrantbible  which contains the first four  and which is the only thing known to contain the first four.  Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was Its faith  Bill.  You dont have any more or better truths than anyone else. Whatever works for you.  Just dont foist it on others.

 Accepting Jeesus in your heart     ,Organization  University of Oulu  FinlandLines  135Jason Smith  jasons atlastele.com  wrote      The discussion begins  why does the universe exist at all       One of the Laws of Nature  specifying cause and effect seems to dictate    at least to this laymans mind  there must be a causal event.  No  reasonable alternative exists.I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must bean answer to  how  did the universe  our spacetime   emerge from  nothing   science has some good candidates for an answer.I have always wondered why Christians use the  There are questionsscience  or atheism  cannot answer  argument  I hope this is theappropriate group to ask this question.The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does theuniverse exist  or anything  for that matter I think this question should actually be split into two parts  namely1  Why is there existence  Why anything exists and2  How did the universe emerge from nothing It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However is it a meaningful question  after all I would say it isnt. Consider the following A die hard skeptic being  be it human or whatever  attempts to doubtones very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else  I cannot be _sure_ the world exists  it may be my mind fooling me  can I ever be sure I exist However  it is only possible to exist or not to exist.  Someoneinsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here      A being that does not exist cannot doubt ones existence.A being that does exist can doubt ones existence  but this would bepointless   the being would exist anyway.Let us return to the original question  why  A being that does notexist does not need any reasons for its non existence. This beingis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind  but letus assume that the world exists independent of the mind  the objectivitypostulate . The question  why anything exists  can be countered bydemanding answer to a question  why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence . Actually  both questions turn out to bedevoid of meaning. Things that exist do  and things that dont existdont exist. Tautology at its best.I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually  God isHimself the existence. However  I see several problems with thisanswer. First  it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God isactually _all_ existence  good and evil  devils and angels  us andthem. This is pantheism  not Christianity.Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.This sounds much better  but I am tempted to ask  Does GodHimself exist  then  If God is the source of His own existence it can only mean that He has  in terms of human time  alwaysexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.This argument sounds like God does not exist  but meta exists and from His meta existent perspective  He created existence.I think this is actually a nonsolution  a mere twist of words.The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapableof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself  I do notaccept such answers  since I do not have any other methods.The second question  How did the universe emerge from nothing belongs to the domain of science  and I  for one  do not doubt thequestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists havesuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emergefrom vacuum  this possibility has been suggested in a recentHawking biography  see also Lizhi   Shuxian  Creation of the Universe World Scientific  1989 . However  I think the sci groups are moreappropriate for discussions like this.   As far as I can tell  the very laws of nature demand a  why .  That isnt  true of something outside of nature  i.e.   super natural .This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us  how  not why  something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the  why questions would be bound only to natural things  assuming that thesupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist  it isas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   I believe the  genetic code  will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes   but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining    reproducing life   ever .   Ive never been much of a prophet  though. I  cant even  picture  New York in my mind 8    .  I dont believe  any   technology would be able to produce that necessary  spark  of life  despite  having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.This opinion is also called vitalism  namely  that living systems aresomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christiansin general adopt this position  What would happen when scientists announcethey have created primitive life  say  small bacteria  in a lab There is a problem with your prophecy  artificial life has been created although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolutioncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium  althoughtheir code is electronic  as well as their metabolism. See a recent bookSteven Levy  Artificial life   The Quest for a New Creation. JonathanCape  London 1992.Artificial chemical life is just around the corner   after all  no spark of life has been found to be necessary  living systems do notviolate any physical laws as we know them.   You dont mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your  research  do you   After all  if we of Christ are deluding ourselves  you  really have nothing to worry about  eh Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelicalatheist arguments to soc.religion groups  since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I wouldnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc but it seems many Christians do not read these groups. Petri   ___. . .

So  according to you  Jim  the only way to criticize one person for   taking a quote out of context  without being a hypocrite  is to post a   response to  every  person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context     Did I either ask or assert that   Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again    1   Stephen said you took a quote out of context  2   You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article       call it A  that took a quote out of context  3   But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the      lack of X   a common creationist error   4   So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the      conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in AExcellent.  Now under what conditions could such a conclusion be made  otherthan a direct assertion by his part.  For instance  am I to assume thatyou have no position on eating shit merely because you have not saidyour position  or might a conclusion be made by observing that you do not.  7   I assumed you were being logical  and that the sentence that begins       Could you please explain ...  was not a nonsequitur  but was intended      to follow from the sentence that preceded it. Is that better Jim    Its called an argument.  If you disagree with it  explain why the argument is not sound.   I admit that my assumption in  7  may have been a bit hasty.   If you agree with it  just say  yup. Have you  by chance  ever even heard of inductive logic   You are notdemonstrating any familiarly with it  i.e. you are being insufficientlylogical .

Wake up   People are just not like that.  It seems evident from history that no society has succeeded when it had to rely upon the goodwill and unselfishness of the people.  Isnt it obvious from places like Iran that even if there are only a few greedy people in society then they are going to be attracted to positions of power   Sounds like a recipe for disaster.       Leonard               e mail   L.Newnham bradford.ac.ukLeonard  Ill give you an example of this....My father recently bought a business  the business price was 150 000 poundsand my father approached the people in the community for help  he raised60 000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and Muslims he knew  50 000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan  afterpaying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loansto help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest  thisis an example of a Muslim community helping one another  why did they helpbecause of their common identity as Muslims. In turn my father has helpedwith people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those morefortunate in the community. The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight iThat is the beauty of Islam.Mas   C I T I Z E N                                                     _____   _____    C A D E N C E  D E S I G N  S Y S T E M S  Inc.        _          Masud Ahmed Khan mas cadence.com All My Opinions _____   _____

What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do ,Distribution  worldOrganization  Chaos liveReply To  chris alien.saar.deX Software  HERMES GUS 1.10 Rev. Mar  3 1993MIME Version  1.0Content Type  text plain  charset US ASCIIContent Transfer Encoding  7bitLines  82In  C5L5x0.KJ7 vcd.hp.com   John Eaton writes     ...  During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor. There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.  Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1 . This law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 1  should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.  John Eaton  hp vcd johne I think you posted your article 15 days too late      April 1st is over.I dont like nuclear powerplants but i think its not fair to tell such storys  about them. OK  Let me try to explain what that tower is used to     1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam engine.         It has an hightech  boiler  but the rest is still verry verry          conventional. And if youve already visited any condensation          powerstation youl have seen the cooling towers too.         If you look at any good book about thermophysics youll find         a chapter about the  CARNOT process  which describes how to         get energy from a temperature difference   And that is the reason         for cooling towers too     You only can get energy if youve an         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one          side and need to cool down the steam till you get water         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30  of the          energy you  or better the uranium  brought into the water to         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and  cold          steam on the other side youll loose much more of the energy.         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30  of         energy that carnot will give them.         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam           The vapor youll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation          because that steam is radioactive   The circulation is divided in         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent         radioactive pollution of the environment               2nd. OK  the main core IS hot  but even in the modernst HighTemperature          Reactors  HTR  they only run at  800 deg celsius. This is still         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere         around 2000 deg. celsius   But youll have lots of problems with         the boilers steel. Thats because at this temperature the         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.         This is only for BWRs. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.     3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem wont be 0.75 mRem         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years youll still have         1.5 mRem. And im not interested in glowing in the night and         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

some thoughts ,"Organization  The University of AdelaideLines  123Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  adelphi.itd.adelaide.edu.auKeywords  Dan Bissellbissda saturn.wwc.edu  DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL  writes  	First I want to start right out and say that Im a Christian.  It  makes sense to be one.  Have any of you read Tony Campollos book  liar   lunatic  or the real thing    I might be a little off on the title  but he  writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity   in the process he became a Christian himself.I assume you are posting to encourage comments   how much history hasTony Campello read   Not much it seems.  	The arguements he uses I am summing up.  The book is about whether  Jesus was God or not.  I know many of you dont believe  but listen to a  different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what  others have to say.  It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.If only those christian  scientists  would take note. In Australia there is a very strong movement  a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactlytrue  and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justifiedby using the laws of physics.  For example  there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old  and that theerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years  and this has not been accounted for.       	The book says that Jesus was either a liar  or he was crazy   a  modern day Koresh  or he was actually who he said he was.Or  of course   that he never existed  and the bible was a story  and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that oneup  	Some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie   Wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar   People  gathered around him and kept doing it  many gathered from hearing or seeing  someone who was or had been healed.  Millions of people have  died for a lie .  This  point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined  a great many religious argumentswork in that way   but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victoryof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost  BTW. Call me a fool  but I believe he did heal people.  That is perfectly reasonable  but it is not grounds for me  or anyone to become a christian.  More to the point  it does not add weight tothe claim that Jesus was the  real thing . 	Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful  in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool  logical people see  this right away.Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany   More to thepoint  did Tony mention this   One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and hismany colleagues  fools  or  illogical men  their support of Hitler was based  I presume  upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitlerwas sane....  	Therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic  he must have been the  real thing.  Hmmm.... I dont think his arguments warrant the use of a  Therefore...  	Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  the psalms  Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  and Crucifixion.  I dont have my Bible with me at this moment  next time I  write I will use it.This is  unfortunately  what alot of religious discussions I have had withpeople result in   quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I thinkpeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort ofmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying topresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally  he orshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   Tonys argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believethe events described in the bible took place  but to convince someone  who thinks the bible is total fiction  that Jesus is real by quoting thebook is totally pointless.  For example  in mathematics you cannot say  a isequal to b because a is equal to b .   	I dont think most people understand what a Christian is.  That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars  and why there are hundreds of different versions allclaiming to be correct.  It  is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  should be a way of life  and a total sacrafice of everything for Gods  sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  same.  Hey we cant do it  God himself inspires us to turn our lives  over to him.  Thats tuff and most people dont want to do it  to be a  real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  just like weight lifting or guitar playing  drums  whatever it takes  time.  We dont rush it in one day  Christianity is your whole life.   It is not going to church once a week  or helping poor people once in  a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  time  sports  Tv  social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ourselves.  	  I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flamesthan here    .  I have never really understood why the emotional sentimentsof a stranger should be of interest to other people. Someone famous said that there two evils in life  polititians and churchs  onerules by fear of the living  the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed Icould probably find the exact quotation.Cheers Charles."

For  example  why does the universe exist at all   Must there be a  why  to this   I ask because of what you also     assume about God   namely  that He just exists  with no  why      to His existence.  So the question is reversed   Why cant     we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to      just exist    Why must there be a  why  to the universe    After all  the time space  world didnt have to exist.  Why does  anything  exist  And  is it  possible for persons  e.g. man  to come into being out of a purely  impersonal cosmos   These questions which look at the real mysteries of  life    the creation of the world and of persons    provide a permanent  indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be  found  outside  that world  in its Source.It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also     create man.  Now  I dont see this happening in my lifetime      nor do I assert it is probable.  But the possibility is there      given scientists are working hard at  decoding  out  genetic     code  to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.     Again  though  must there be  why  or a  divine prupose  to     mans existence   When you say that man is  only  an animal  I have to think that you are  presenting an unprovable statement    a dogma  if you will.  And one  the requires a kind of  faith  too.   By taking such a hard line in  your atheism  you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.As far as we can tell  man falls into the  mammal  catagory.  Now      if there were something more to the man  say  a soul   then     we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now  man     is a mammal  babies are born live  mother gives milk  were     warm blooded  etc.  as other mammals are and is similar in     genetic construction to some of them  in particular  primates .     For more on this check out talk.origins.  But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow  I hope  youll do a little research into its history and varieties  perhaps by  reading Paul Johnsons  A History of Christianity .  From your remarks   it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian  religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in  Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth  and  be animated by some enduring values.Well  then  Buddhism  Confucianism  Taoism  Hinduism  Judaism      Zoerasterism  Shintoism  and Islam should fit this bit of logic     quite nicely...      All have depth  all have enduring values      thus all must be true...Stephen    _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _    _        _       Atheist   _         _     _    _  _  _  _        Libertarian  _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _    _    _   _         Pro individuality       _   _      _   _        _          Pro responsibility_ _ _ _   _       _  _        _  Jr.      and all that jazz...

HELP   SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx,Keywords  SCSI  IIfxOrganization  NASA Ames Research Center Lines  46I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years oldand I have been using the same hard drive  internal Maxtor LXT 200S  fortwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted  Silverlining5.42   but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.The error message reported was like Sector 0  Write error detected after testing good   sector not mapped out.This occurred randomly all over the hard disk  which makes me suspect thediagnostics reference to Sector 0      . On the third reformat and afterreinstalling the SCSI read write loops I was able to get through passes2 3  and 4 with no errors.  Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors but still mapped out no sectors.  I decided to go ahead and try to resinstallSystem 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally  however I now have sub optimal performance. Symptoms include    o Frequent crashes   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to       correct.   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.         If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs  it cannot find the         disk either.         The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes         requires several attempts.QUESTIONS    1  Has anyone had this type of problem before    2  Is the problem with the fx motherboard  And its non standard      SCSI implementation  or with my Maxtor Disk  Is there some      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination    3  Is it a termination problem  I currently have external Syquest      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the      end  and has internal termination  so I am not using the IIfx      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1 2 years with      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat  about a year ago .      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices       so I dont see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of      course who knows    Help would be much appreciated.Forrest E.

To get emergency medical care  anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital  you must notify Blue Cross  or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency  where you must be treated before notifying them   you must inform them within 24 hours or  if you are unable to do so for medical reasons  the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them  and without the card  the hospital certainly wouldnt know they had to.  Therefore  you are required to carry the card at all times  or do without emergency medical coverage.

Mormon Temples,Organization  Boeing Computer ServicesLines  25mserv mozart.cc.iup.edu  Mail Server  writes  One thing I dont understand is why being sacred should make the temple rituals secret.  On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that theyshould not be spoken of in a  common manner  or  trampled underfeet  such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies areperformed in the temple because the temple has been set asideas being as sacred holy uncommon place.  We believe that the ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when theyare viewed with the right spirit  which in this case is in thetemple.  So from our point of view  when they are broughtout into the public  they are being trampled under feet because of misinterpretations and mocking  and it is thereforeoffensive to us.Please do not assume that because of my use of the wordswe and our that Im an official spokesman for the LDSchurch.

So it means that  you just can  not put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its  orbit will be unstable    If so  what is the reason    Is that because  the combined gravitacional atraction of the Sun Moon and Earth  that does not provide a stable  orbit around the Moon   Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections  and whenits fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollomotherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a fewdays.  It is  possible  that there are stable orbits here and there   the Moons gravitational field is poorly mapped    but we know of none.Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at lowaltitudes.  The big problem is that the Moons own gravitational fieldis quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.   All work is one mans work.

Are all truths also absolutes    Is all of scripture truths  and therefore absolutes        If the answer to either of these questions is no  then perhaps you can    explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths  and   which truths are absolutes.      The answer to both questions is yes.Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me an absolute is something that is constant across time  culture situations  etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agreewith this definition   I think you do   Similarly  all truth is absolute.  Indeed  a non absolute truth is a   contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute   When it is always  true.  Obviously  if a  truth  is not always  true  then we have a  contradiction in terms.  A simple example In the New Testament  sorry I dont have a Bible at work  and cantprovide a reference   women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now  this is scripture.  By your definition  this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak   Do they cover their heads   If all scripture is absolute truth  it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet  clearly  women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.   At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in. Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.   And there are plenty of other examples. Can you reconcile this   Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a  statement is terribly self contradictory.  Let me put it to you this  way.  If there are no absolutes  shouldnt we conclude that the statement    There are no absolutes  is not absolutely true   Obviously  we have a  contradiction here.I dont claim that there are  no  absolutes.  I think there are veryfew  though  and determining absolutes is difficult.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming  that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   There is hardly consensus  even in evangelical    Christianity  not to mention the rest of Christianity  regarding    Biblical interpretation.    So   People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate   the fact  however  that there are still absolutes in the universe.  But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you cant agree howto interpret the Scripture   Its very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own  interpretation  is absolute.  Do you deny that your ownbackground  education  prejudices  etc. come into play when you read the Bible  and determine how to interpret a passsage   Do you deny that you in fact interpret Carol Alvincaralv auto trol.com

Will Italy be the Next Domino to Fall ,Lines  101Reply To  hallam zeus02.desy.deOrganization  DESYDeutsches Elektronen Synchrotron  Experiment ZEUS bei HERAIn article  C5GK0w.J8H newsserver.technet.sg   ipser solomon.technet.sg  Ed Ipser  writes   Will Italy be the Next Domino to Fall         Socialism may have collapsed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Disunion  but it lingers on in Western Europe and the United States. It remains  the primary ideology in the hearts and minds of the liberal academia  and media. But all the political correctness they can muster may not be  sufficient to hold back the economic forces that threaten to spread  socialisms collapse from the second world to the first. Indeed  it is  becoming more apparent every day that socialism may not even survive  the turn of the century.Ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism  or any other political system come to that.  While the Swedes have already discarded their  third way  and the  French have made history by turning out the Socialist Party in a   record setting defeat  it is Italy that appears most precariously  on the edge of its political existence.That leaves Germany  Japan and the UK as examples of a country where theright wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USAwhich just elected a socialist government      Italy  today  is a basket case even by European standards. It has  introduced 17 new taxes in 5 months and public sector revenue is at or  near the 50  of GDP mark. Etc  unfortunately you cant pin this on the left or the right  both areto blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalistseparatists and the communist party which has collapsed.  In spite of this political gluteny  it has  an annual deficit exceeding the sum of all other EC countries and a  public debt 2.5 times that of Latin America. Italy is understandably  having serious trouble selling its treasury bonds in the markets. And  while Italy is an extreme case  it is anything but unique  all  European governments appear headed in the same direction in spite of  their nominally non socialist governments.    Unfortunately  Europeans being  well  Europeans  it is very unlikely  that they will discover American style liberty. Instead  they will  likely lurch from socialism to fascism as quickly as they had moved  from fascism to socialism never pausing along the way to reasseses the  role of government  itself. I hope I am wrong.Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created togetherbefore he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budgetdeficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed Ipser type freed thank you.We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyersfor the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkablylittle being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in bysocialism.The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free educationand health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achievedacross the whole of Europe  only the USA is struggling to catch up. Theproblem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.  Nobody ever claimed that the collapse of socialism would be pretty.  The decline of the nation state will probably lead first to anarchy  since politicians always cut essential services before pork. Los  Angeles has rampant crime and frantically waits for the next wave of  riots but it has a spanking new subway that nobody wants to use and  which  like every other public transit system in the world  will never  be economically viable.  If you were trying to extort tax payers   which would you cut first  mass transit or police protection  Ed starts to discus LA  presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. Onthe other hand he most probably hasnt heard of a European city.  Thus does the world hurtle toward chaos even as the 21st century  approaches.Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist partyhas collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right andleft wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialistsare in charge this week is incidental  the right is into the corruption justas baddly.What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do muchbetter in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are goingto get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to peoplewho are free of any hint of corruption. Look out for a parliament ofPavarottis and porn stars.Phill Hallam Baker
 Full page  PB screen,Organization  Junior  Social   Decision Sciences  Carnegie Mellon  Pittsburgh  PALines  31NNTP Posting Host  po2.andrew.cmu.eduHi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and Id like toask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create amarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important atthis point.  Well  my groups plan is to market a  full page  monitorfor laptop computers.  It would be a third party product to be installedby authorized repair centers  like Newer Technologys PaletteBookscreen .  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that youwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen  remember technical issues aside  .  In fact  by adjusting the fold of the screenand the monitor configuration  you could have regular OR  full  height. The screen would probably be monochrome.The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be verypopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use wordprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenientto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users andapplications  color screens arent really a neccessity.  We couldhopefully keep the cost between  2000 and  3000.Now  please dont write this off as completely ridiculous.  I reallyneed some constructive feedback.  So  if you would  please reply to mevia email and let me know 1. If you would consider buying a  full page  laptop screen2. How much you would be willing to pay for it3. Any helpful commentaries on the ideaAlso  if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it  doubtful but who knows    please send me some.Thanks in advance    Mike

Let him. It might save some               miniscule portion of his sorry face.               Not really. since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself            from any  name calling   i started trashing any article that contains            such abuses without responding to  and sometimes not even reading articles             written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company        deleted stuff       well   ok. lets see what Master of Wisdom  Mr. Jonas Flygare       wrote that can be wisdomely responded to        Are you calling names  or giving me a title  If the first  read your    paragraph above  if not I accept the title  in order to let you get into the   um  well  debate again.I didnot know that  Master of wisdom  can be  name clling  too unless you consider yourself deserve less        Master of Wisdom writes in  1993Mar31.101957 frej.teknikum.uu.se               hasan              flax                 hasan                      In case you didNOT know  Palestineans were there for 18 months.                   and they are coming back                  when you agree to give Palestineans their HUMAN RIGHTS.                     Afterall  human rights areNOT negotiable.                  Correct me if Im wrong  but isnt the right to ones life _also_               a human right   Or does it only apply to palestinians                No. it is EVERYBODYs right. However  when a killer kills  then he is giving            up  willingly or unwillingly   his lifes right to the society.             the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by             depriving the killer off his lifes right.            So then its all right for Israel to kill the people who kill Israelis          The old eye for an eye thinking  Funny  I thought modern legal systems         were made to counter exactly that.         So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you  Master of Wsidom     							                                                                                  If you insist on giving me names titles I did not ask for you could at   least spell them correctly.  sigh.That was only to confuse you   ha ha ha hey        when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that       the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE        and hence ALL their actions  their courts  their laws are illegitimate on       the ground of occupied territories.      No  I am _not_ neglecting that  Im merely asking you whether the existance   of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right	               are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here.   to live  a  as you so eloquently put it  human right. We can get back to the    question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also  you have    not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.First  my above statement doesnot say that  the existence of israeli citizensin the WB revoke their right of life  but it says  the israeli occupationof the WB revoke the right of life for some most its citizens   basicallyrevokes the right of for its military men . Clearly  occupation is anundeclared war  during war  attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. Secondly  surely israeli have human rights  but they ask their goverment toprotect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories  not by further oppressingPalestinean human rights.      What do you expect me to tell you  Master of Wisdom  when I did explain my      point in the post  that you  responded to . The point is that since Israel       is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights       to the Occupied Palestineans  which is exactly similar the automatic       deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.      If a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions  then    tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all Because not all states are like Israel  as oppressive  as ignorant  or as tyrant.            What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue             The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law             US law  Israeli law  ...         deleted  Jonas was throwing up not for real so you can stick to the screen             It seems that the US law  represented by US State dept in this case             is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories.            Anyway  as for Hamas  then obviously they turned to the islamic system.            And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem          The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why   because      any system can solve it.       The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here  all palestine .       I asked for which system should be used  that will preserve human rights for                                                                                  all people involved. I assumed that was obvious  but I wont repeat that    mistake. Now that I have straightened that out  Im eagerly awaiting your    reply.So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights. i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph .      Joseph Weitz  administrator responsible for Jewish colonization        said it best when writing in his diary in 1940    	    Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both   	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal   						                           	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.   	   The only solution is a Palestine  at least Western Palestine  west of   	   the Jordan river  without Arabs.... And there is no other way than   	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries  to   	   transfer all of them  not one village  not one tribe  should be    	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to   	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.    				   DAVAR  29 September  1967   				     Courtesy  of Marc Afifi       Just a question  If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to    getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS   charter  thats the english translations  if you have other information Id   be interested to have you translate it  why should we give any credence to    a _private_ paper even older  Im not going to get into the question if he   wrote the above  but its fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have   their share of fanatics. Guess what..  Those are not the people that will   make any lasting peace in the region.  more deleted stuff Exactly  you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with  men like Joseph Weitz.        We  and  our  either refers to Zionists or Jews  i donot know which .          Well  i can give you an answer  you Master of Wisdom  I will NOT suggest the       imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem           I think that is fair enough .      No  that is _not_ an answer  since I asked for a system that could solve    the problem. You said any could be used  then you provided a contradiction.Above you wrote that you understood what i meant  underlined by      any system can be used to solve the conflict   but not any system would resolve it JUSTLY.   Guess where that takes your logic  To never never land. You are proving yourself as a    . First you understood what i meant  but thenyou claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic. Too bad for you  the Master of Wisdom.       The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children .   			    Rabbi Shoham.      Oh  and by the way  let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are   a real bummer  when I try giving your posts any credit.Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in   if you were aZionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts  well i feel sorry for you because the same Rabbi Shoham had said  Yes  Zionism is racism .If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes  then drop Zionism.If you are not Zionist  why are you bothered then.

Screw the people  crypto is for hard core hackers   spooks only,Organization  C Set 2 Development  IBM Canada Lab.Disclaimer  This posting represents the posters views  not those of IBMLines  33   I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in abig hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket themrather than soldering them  since once the keys are handed over by theescrow agencies  the chip is so much garbage  and will need to bereplaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatiblechip that uses secure encryption    possibly even disguised so that itsnot possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the2 backdoor keys.   If I were to manufacture such a chip  as part of my marketingstrategy  I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies eitherthrough bribes or industrial espionage    and then publicize the fact. doing my best not to be connected with such activities    which wouldlikely not be legal     Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies wouldgo quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme  and help growthe market demand for a secure alternative. I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will makefew friends in the LE community  but lots of money. I also believe thatthe government will do its best to make such plug replacements illegal.I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availabilityof such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability ofcertain illicit drugs    ie. little to none.Regards Ian Ameline.

A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County  Wash.  found thata gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse  a friend  or child than to kill an intruder.  Studies by the Western Psychiatric Institute  in Pittsburgh  found that the mere presenceof a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family memberwill commit suicide  even in the absence of psychiatric illness. I have seen these numbers quoted before  and I have seen very specificrefutation of them quoted as well.

I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading   this group  from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5   different groups out of this is a wate  and will only result in a few posts   a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum   for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way    Just curious.I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all thesplit groups  and it would make things easier for those of uswho are less omnivorous.  There is no  waste  in creating newsgroups    its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problemwith only a few posts per week per group   I spend too much timeon this as it is. david"

The deficits declined from 84 9  reaching a low of 2.9  of GNP before       the tax and spending hike of 1990 reversed the trend.           Brett   Is this true    Some more details would be appreciated.      cheersActually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.What declined from 84 to 89  as I remember it  was _percentincrease_in_deficit_growth  i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time  decreased.Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficitdeclined.  If you keep spending more than you earn  the deficit keepsgrowing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowedpreviously  the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when yourincome exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.Figgies book paints the real data  pictorially  in gory detail.  Eachpresident  essentially ran up twice as much total debt  in half the time.Reagan congress was simply awful.  Bush congress was unbelievable.As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....During pledge night the other night on the public channel  there was an economist  who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictiveand based largely on population data. I dont know his name  but hisarguments were brilliant.  He confirmed  with data  what many of us knowwith common sense    the boom of the 80s has nothing to do with governmentpolicy  particularly  supply side  policy  since taxes do not  cause  economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be explained by watching population waves roll through the years and create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well intothe middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate heis.Paul Collacchi

The problem is  the methods were using now dont do the trick.     Dont manufacture them.  Dont sell them.  Dont import them.         Some guns will get through  but far fewer  and far less people will     die because of them.  Hunting weapons could be allowed  of course  as     long as they are big  and bulky  and require reloading after a few     shots  how many times can you shoot at the same animal  anyways One     assumes they are moving  A better solution   If the bad people cant be trusted with guns  then lock them or knock  them off.

The documentationis no help at all. As an example  it says The serial port can be changed toCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers. but does not say what jumpers to move      There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows C1C2S2P2P1GThe second bank is labeled  IRQ  and has the following labels 5C5S433S2C2SI have determined that the C1   C2 jumpers tell it to address the firstserial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1 P2 jumpers tell it to use the printerport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the  G  enables the game port andthe  S2  SHOULD enable the second serial port  but I cant get it to work. Ihave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume thatthis bank must tell the card which IRQs to use for both ports  but I don tknow how.

I will oblige.Trumpets  please. My name is Elias Davidsson  Icelandic citizen  born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the undesirables  at that times this group was defined as Jews . She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors.  Forced to go to Palestine.   How dreadful.  Unlike otherundesirables Jews  she wasnt forced to go into a gas chamber  forcedunder a bulldozer  thrown into a river  forced into a  Medicalexperiment  like a rat  forced to march until she dropped dead  burnedto nothingness in a crematorium.  Your mother was  forced to go toPalestine.   You have our deepest sympathies. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland  30 years ago  We are pleased to hear of your escape.  At least you wont have tosuffer the same fate that your mother did. and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland  Palestine  Your homeland  Palestine    because of the same reason  they belonged to the indesirables . Should we assume that you are refering here to Jews who were kickedout of their homes in Jerusalem during the Jordanian Occupation ofEast Jerusalem   These are the same people who are now being calledthieves for re claiming houses that they once owned and lived in andnever sold to anyone  These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime  Theyare not Jews. I have never heard of NOT being a Jew as a crime.  Certainly inIsrael  there is no such crime.  In some times and places BEING a Jewis a crime  but NOT being a Jew     My conscience does not accept such injustice  period. Our brains do not accept your logic  yet  either. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support   as long as their protest is based on a principled position  but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The way youve written this  you seem to accept criticism in the Arabworld UNLESS it deflects criticism from Israel  in which case  we haveto presume  you no longer support criticism of the Arab world. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.Look whos taling about discrimination now  The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains  and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds.Be careful.  You are starting to sound like Barfling. Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.  I would hope that discussion about Israel Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.Good.  Dont call yourself  ARF  or  the Center for Policy Research  either.

Question for those with popular morality,Reply To  david terminus.ericsson.seDistribution  worldOrganization  Camtec Electronics  Ericsson   Leicester  EnglandLines  77Nntp Posting Host  bangkokIn article 17570 freenet.carleton.ca  ad354 Freenet.carleton.ca  James Owens  writes   In a previous article  david terminus.ericsson.se  David Bold  says      I dont mean to be rude  but I think that youve got hold of the wrong  end of a different stick...    David  I had a look at your posting again and I see what you mean   I was so intent on explaining how Jung thought we could be more moral than God that I overlooked your main line of thought.  You seem to be saying that  God being unknowable  His morality is unknowable.Yep  thats pretty much it. Im not a Jew but I understand that this is theJewish way of thinking. However  the Jews believe that the Covenant betweenYHWH and the Patriarchs  Abraham and Moses  in this case  establishes a MoralCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundariesfall  though.As I understand it  the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that wasrequired  whereas the Pharisees  the ancestors of modern Judaism  believed thatthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required Morality in all its nuances    Talmud .The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface betweenMan and YHWH  for a Jew or Christian  and does not necessarily indicateanything about YHWH outside of that relationship  although one can speculate .  The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created in His image  so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we are supposed to live by Christs example  you would be hard pressed to argue that God is a  do what I say  not what I do  kind of guy.The trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the  createdin His image  means. Ive heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart ifone wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation  to mix metaphorsunashamedly   As to living by Christs example  we know very little aboutJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers  and some very small references from comtemporary historians.Revelation aside  one can only  know  Christ second hand or worse.This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity  although it may seem that wayinitially   the point I m trying to make is that we only really have the Bibleto interpret  and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is whereFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.  Metaphysically  if there are multiple moral codes then there is no Absolute moral code  and I think this is theologically questionable.No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiplemoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode. As an example  a parent may tell a child never to swear  and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is  wrong . Now  the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar  where there are no children . The  wrongness  here is ifthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is  inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent  and may be a parent later in life  butyou get the gist of it  Incidentally  the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older  see Piaget  and learns a morality of his own.David.

If fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line.From this account  it doesnt sound like you even saw the goal  Mike. Smithcame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in theback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw whathappened. The puck went straight off Fuhrs leg and into the net. Fuhr neverhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender  in fact Perry Berezanof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. It was unfortunate that it happened  Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookieat the time  and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Startingin pee wee coaches tell players never to make a cross ice pass in front of their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted  or hitting the goaltender  or whatever.And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series  I can onlysay that he certainly didnt cause the team to lose the other three games.There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied latein the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the teamhas to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.								Alan"
quality of Catholic liturgy,Organization  The Ohio State UniversityLines  37I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering mywife and me lately  liturgy  in particular  Catholic liturgy.  In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  Itsdriving me crazy   The most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together  because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest  of course  which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses Ive been to were participatory prayers.Lately  I think the proportion of participation has fallen  and the proportionof sitting there and watching  or listening  or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows whats happening next  is growing.Example.  Last Sunday  Palm Sunday  we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday  the congregation participates in reading the Passion  takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound  when we say Crucify him  we mean it.  We did it  and if He came back today wed do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were  invited  to sitduring the Gospel   Passion  and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian  invitation   I was really saddened to have my  and our  little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people  and toward themusicians  readers  and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows whats happening  the new things have to beexplained  and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass were justsitting there listening  or spacing out  in my case  to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind  I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts   but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing  thats just a fact ofbureaucratic life  even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lords presence.So weve been wondering  are we the oddballs  or is the quality of the Massgoing down   I dont mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of Gods presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up     Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately John Murray
Estimating Wiretap Costs Benefits,Nntp Posting Host  jabberwock.arc.nasa.govOrganization  NASA ARC Information Sciences DivisionLines  38Im attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether theproposed wiretap  or  Clipper   chip is a cost effective tool forpolice investigation.  That is  ignoring concerns about governmentintrusions into individual privacy  is the value of easy wiretaps toinvestigators greater than the cost to the communications industry and their customers  to support this wiretap technology   A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five milliondollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.   In 1990  872 U.S.wiretaps led to 2057 arrests  while total police expenditures of  28billion led to 11.25 million arrests  ref US Statistical Abstracts .

Pixie        p.s.  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists  why do you follow it blindly   	Why do we follow God so blindly   Have you ever asked aphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog The answer is quite simple  the dog can see  and the blind personcannot.	I acknowledge  as a Christian  that I am blind.  I see but I see  illusions as well as reality.   Watched TV lately  I hear  but I hear lies as well as truth.   Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.   Remember  all that tastes well isnot healthy.  So  I rely one the one who can see  hear  andtaste everything  and knows what is real  and what is not.That is God.	Of course  you may ask  if I cannot trust my own senses how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth ora lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must forceourselves to believe that God knows the truth  and loves usenough to share it with us  even when it defies what we thinkwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world 	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  WhenI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience  because it is what my Father commands me to do  and I seethe results in the long term  I find that He has led mein the proper direction  even though it did not feel rightat the time.  This is where our works as Christians areimportant   As exercises of the body make the body strong excercises of faith make the faith strong.  	As for you  no one can  convert  you.  You mustchoose to follow God of your own will  if you are ever tofollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share withyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that we have to accept your decision  although we always keepthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find outwhy we believe what we believe  I can only suggest you trypraying for faith  reading the Bible  and asking Christiansabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow tounderstand why we believe what we do  in defiance of thelogic of this world.	May the Lord bring peace to you  						Malcusco         "
WH proposal from Police point of view,"Organization  University of Maryland  Baltimore County CampusLines  30Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  umbc7.umbc.eduX Auth User  olsonIn article  1993Apr18.034352.19470 news.clarkson.edu   tuinstra sunspot.ece.clarkson.edu.soe  Dwight Tuinstra  writes    It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a   police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them  too.      OK  suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspects phone.  They   need a warrant  just like the old days.  But unlike the old days  they   now need to           a  get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of          the key.      Now  what happens if theres a tiff between the two escrow houses    Posession release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.	While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federalagencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order  there is still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to performa wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the  possiblyincomplete  understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning  only theFBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer  which seemsto be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This movesa great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuadepeople who dont generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  Anational police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political viewpoints.olson umbc.edu"

In each of these cases  the suspension geometrywill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at theintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottomof the strut  roughly the height of the reduction  will restorethe suspension geometry.

If those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio originally costs  or even sold at all then the above discouragement wouldnt be so great.I personally would be unhappy  if I bought a radio like that  thinking that removing the cover greatly depreciated the radios value  and the covers weresold by the company  or other legitimate source  cheaply.           8        If you cut here  youd ruin your monitor      8        Kenneth D.

I have come to believe that choosing CS because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one doesnot like to program is really doing an injustice of buildingand computer and making it useful for something.  Everythingis interwoven and inseparable.  CS  CE  and EE are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.	My advice is dont limit yourself  but make a decisionbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me toexplore as much as possible.  Beside  I dont know why theschool would make a student choose a major before her hissophamore year.                  	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case  you suffer a little more and go to grad school.	About the money.  Dont look at the averages  if youare good  you are going to earn more money than anyone else. If you are a superstar programmer  you will earn millions.

Christianity and repeated lives,Reply To  Eugene.Bigelow ebay.sun.comOrganization  Sun Microsystems  Inc.Lines  13   ...there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of   repeated lives on earth.There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion  clearly makesa positive inference to reincarnation. I dont remember which one it is off ofthe top of my head  but it basically goes like this  Jesus is talking with theapostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come Elijah must first come. Jesus replies that Elijah has come  but they did not recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering toJohn the Baptist. This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.

The  After market cruise controls,"Organization  BYUNntp Posting Host  128.187.203.40Lines  82Howdy Im a little new to this newsgroup  but I would like to tap some of theknowledge and expertise available here.The Background I recently broke my ankle in a road bicycling accident  4 places  five screws  yuk       .  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas  myhome  from my school  BYU  in Provo  Utah.  As you can imagine  trying todrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome ofa good time.  My car does not have a cruise control  so I would have to doall the pedalling  ha ha  with my messed up ankle.My question What is the general opinion of after market cruise control units   Irealize that a cheap CC  cruise control  from  say  Pep Boys  isnt going tobe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit  if there is such athing .  And I uderstand that I probably cant expect much in the way ofaccuracy  looks and that sort of thing   But anythings gotta be better thantrying to drive with a hosed ankle.I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee  4 speed  standard  4 4  2.5L engine withkettering sp   ignition  yknow  distributor cap  rotor  that set up  notelectronic.  Maybe you couldve guessed it being an 84  but Im just tryingto give information as completly as I can .I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor motor.  Is this good or bad   If I did buythis CC  which vacuum hose should I tap It has two speed sensors   One magnetic  and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor  kinda like a tach pick up  or so Iunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best   The manual says  I readit in the store today  that the magnetic axle set up is more accurate  butharder to install.  Is there really a big difference It has a sensor for the brake pedal  just like other CCs  but does NOT have asensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasnt paying real close attention Imight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Whichwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned the thing off.  Im pretty coordinated  so this doesnt bother me  if itwere for my girlfriends car   then  it would bother me  but Im ok with it.The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady on brake signaland a switched on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signalfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right   But Imnot sure where to get the steady on brake signal  or  for that matter  whatexactly it is   Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to getit I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook up the negativeside tach type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit  and the ground andall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with 	1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk  if any  for such a	    device 	2.  Is there any particularly good after market CC 	3.  Are  professionally  installed CCs signifacantly better and	    worth the cabbage 	4.  If the unit I saw  sorry  no manufacturer or model number  just	    that it is at Pep Boy and its  80  is sufficient for my simple 	    needs  how do I get the thing installed properly  specifically 	    the questions above  My father and I built a  Veep   Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ 2A  when I was inhigh school  so I consider myself fairly good with tools  electronics  andcars.  So the installation doesnt scare me.  I just want to be certain thatI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit morecomplicated than my Veep.    I appreciate your time in reading my post  and I would appreciate anyexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to sharesome of your wisdom  please email as I dont get over this group very often but I check my mail all the time .Again  thanks for any help anyone may have.Mike WiedaMikew canc.byu.edu"

Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts ,Organization  U of Toronto ZoologyLines  17In article  1993Apr20.204335.157595 zeus.calpoly.edu  jgreen trumpet.calpoly.edu  James Thomas Green  writes  Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example  Why couldnt Magellan just be told to go into a  safe  mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low power use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better  hopefully   it could be turned on again.  One consideration to remember is that if you dont turn it off now you may not be able to later.  This isnt a case of reaching over andflipping a switch  much of the spacecraft has to be working correctlyto execute a  turn off  command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunctionin their old age.

Help,"Organization  Motorola LPA DevelopmentLines  87  	   Im a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.  I know  that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds  yet  hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless  saying You fools   do you still think that just believing is enough  Stuff deleted    Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone  not what you do   as taught in Romans  but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James  in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being spat out    Can anyone help me  this really bothers me.Will  there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over ins.r.c.b s.I will make the case here though and try to help you out 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith  and that not of yourselves  itis the gift of God 9 Not of works  lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2 8 9 .Yes  it is by Gods grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are notsaved by what we do.  However 15 If ye love me  keep my commandments. John 14 15 .Keeping Christs commandments is a  work  per se  and a demonstration ofour love for him.  Also 6 He spake also this parable  A certain man had a fig tree planted in hisvineyard  and he came and sought fruit thereon  and found none.7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard  Behold  these three yearsI come seeking fruit on this fig tree  and find none  cut it down  whycumbereth it the ground 8 And he answering said unto him  Lord  let it alone this year also  till Ishall dig about it  and dung it 9 And if it bear fruit  well  and if not  then after that thou shalt cut itdown. Luke 13 6 9 .Again 16 Ye have not chosen me  but I have chosen you  and ordained you  that yeshould go and bring forth fruit  and that your fruit should remain  thatwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name  he may give it you. John 15 16 .It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. What is that fruit.  Well  Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit beinglove  joy  peace  patience  etc.  All of these are things that are manifestin the actions that we carry out.If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ  but does not do the thingsChrist commanded  I dare say  that they really dont have any faith. Asking which is more important  faith or works  is like asking which bladeon a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of yourpants is more important.Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parableabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christscommands are actions  and if we dont do those actions and produce fruit then we shall be uprooted just like the tree. It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actionsprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk fordays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off abuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words  I can sit and tell youall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really dont havethat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take thetest.  Words and talk mean nothing.I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will  butthis should be sufficient.Hope it helped.Jon                sig file broken....please try later...

The fact of the theory,"Reply To  halat pooh.bears  Jim Halat Lines  74In article  C5u6p5.5nx usenet.ucs.indiana.edu   adpeters sunflower.bio.indiana.edu  Andy Peters  writes  ...stuff deleted... Andy   I think we do agree  given your clarification of how we were each using the terms fact and theory.  Ill only add that Ithink perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them though your usage is quite valid. Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  In other words  it could  theoretically  still be falsified and rejected.  But since its so predictive  and so consistently supported by evidence  it seems pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore.Ill add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any wayreduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or describes things we can observe.Not to be a pain in the ass  but is there any reason you dontjust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolutionis still a theory_.  Im asking because this whole thread got startedbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_ basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a clarification  like the one you just gave  just saying _the fact ofevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.   description of atomic theory  and alternative theories of gravity  deleted   Both are very useful models that   have no religious overtones or requirements of faith  unless of course you   want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly   the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.  You have shoehorned the _facts_ of the _existence_ of gravity and atoms and evolution into one category with the _theories_ which have been proposed to explain the _mechanisms_.  The existence of these things is so predictive as to be considered fact.  The mechanisms  on the other hand  are still worth discussing.  Im not sure I agree here.  Again  it may be because I feel strongerabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselvesare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms  not the things themselves  that are so predictive as to be considered fact  as you would say .  There arent really little planetary particle systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say  and more to my original point  it would be a leap of faith to say there are  because we observe only the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  Its enoughto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate  Im not sure I am being any clearer than before  but I thought it was worth a shot.The bottom line  though  is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas    1.   evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence  my way         the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational        evidence  your way    2.   creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it        a theory then he can.  I wont   it has no supporting evidence 	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about  there really isnt	much to say.Do you agree     jim halat         halat bear.com     bear stearns         whatever doesnt kill you will only serve to annoy you     nyc             i speak only for myself"

If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death  due to less that wise driving practices  then TOUGH   Well  I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I would not block a would be passer.  I would not block a would be passer for their own good  or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring apasser under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chancesof being involved in an accident  fatal or otherwise.  In fact  I couldimagine how blocking a would be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being  offed  or involved in an accident  especially if this  passer  is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a personriding your bumper is certainly NOT a  wise driving practice   it only causes the jam to become more congested.  I dont mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the road behind    If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a  pack  of vehicles  I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life  or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper  I signal my intention to move to the right  and do so at the first opportunity    hope they will open the jam .  I feel this is not only courteous driving  but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate     There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights  or  if all else fails  will briefly speed up  slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never safe to ride anyones bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic  because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason  I feel they deserve  at the very least derision.        Sorry this is soooooooo long.

Im willing to speculate that the DX2 50 with local bus will be 2 4 times   as fast as the DX 50 and probably as expensive  or cheap       Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a 486DX50 anda 25MHz local bus.Im waiting for the mezzianine  sp   VL bus that will be decoupled fromthe main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers.This will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard I Ocards. Until the next buss spec...  regards  JV                                                                         name     J V Meuldijk                                            o o    address  gildelaar 4                                             _ _            4847 hw teteringen                                     _   _            holland                  e mail   volkert kub.nl         _     _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__Guy                                                                                   Guy Dawson   Hoskyns Group Plc.        guyd hoskyns.co.uk  Tel Hoskyns UK        71 251 2128        guyd austin.ibm.com Tel IBM Austin USA   512 838 3377
are they worthwhile ,"Organization  National Institute of Standards   TechnologyDistribution  usaLines  50In article  1993Apr19.164451.3744 news.eng.convex.com  dodson convex.COM  Dave Dodson  writes  Is it worthwhile to get an alarm system on a new car Although  others have in the past and will continue to disagreei think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm. What features are important I think that it is important to protect your trunk  engine bay  alldoors.  Id get flashing lights  LEDs mounted on the drivers andpassenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in a glass break sensor  and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.Most important is where you have the installation done   Some placesmay cost a little more  but a poorly installed alarm  no matter howmuch it cost  will be a major burden. What features are unimportant IMO  things like engine starters  voice alarms  window sunroof openand close  and most other conveniences.

Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger GNP than they would _without_ space industry  eventually  they will simply be able to afford more stuff.If I read you right  youre saying in essence that  with a largereconomy  nations will have more discretionary funds to  waste on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo  but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military scientific  or commercial reason for being rather than just a  we have the money  why not   approach.Its conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose  its possiblethat Luna will have a commercial purpose  but its most likely thatLuna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundredyears at least. Therefore  Lunar bases should be predicated on fundinglevels little different from those found for Antarctic bases.

VESA on the Speedstar 24,Organization  H gskolan i J nk pingLines  39Nntp Posting Host  pc5_b109.et.hj.se   kjb MGL uvesa32.zip      This is a universal VESA driver.  It supports most video   boards chipsets  include the Speedstar 24 and  24X  up to   24 bit color.      Terry      P.S.  Ive tried it on a Speedstar 24 and  24X and it works.     Not with all software.    For instance it doesnt work at all with  Animator Pro from Autodesk. It cant detect ANY SVGA modes when   running UniVESA. This is really a problem as we need a VESA driver  for both AA Pro and some hi color stuff.    Just out of curiosity... Are you using the latest version  3.2    Versions previous to this did not fill in all of the capabilities bits and other information correctly.  I had problems with a lot of software until I got this version.   I dont think the author got around to posting an  announcementof it  or at least I missed it   but 3.2 was available in the  directory indicated as of 3 29. I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOTwith Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me. Prettyuseless program without that thing working IMHO.So I hope the author can fix that.

I am not as old as 1964  but Iveheard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did thatseason. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season inmid August.  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and theCardinals took the division.  15    games ahead and lost it.... Ihope this season is MUCH different.

They  have  spoken out  cf Secy of State Christophers recent trip to the ME    Note the clause  more forcibly   above.     My point is that they have  made a few pro forma  perfunctory remarks  and sent in a few C 130s and  so forth  but its clearly not something theyre losing much sleep over.  Theyre just going through the motions  while Moslems are being  ethnically  cleansed  out of what used to be Yugoslavia.   The US has been speaking  out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world  forums.    Besides  theres no case that can be made for US military involvement    there that doesnt apply equally well to  say  Liberia  Angola  or     it appears with the Khmer Rouges new campaign  Cambodia.   Non whites    dont count   Hmm...some might say Kuwaitis are non white. Ooops  I forgot  Kuwaitis are  oil rich    loaded with petro dollars   etc so they dont count.  Precisely.

Over the last fewyears I have heard of one case after another of government runningcompletely amok.  Unfortunately  most people are oblivious of thegovernments crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So Iintend to put together what I call the  American Horror File   acompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshodover the rights of its citizens over the last few years  focusingespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no knock warrants and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws but including any other cases for which I can find decentdocumentation.  I hope to make people blood boiling  artery bursting red hot enraged at their government.The end result will probably be a book in electronic form  ASCII textand postscript files  detailing the governments crimes of recentyears.  This book will be distributed at cost  and I will encouragepeople to post copies to BBSs  send copies on disk to friends  andprint out copies and give them to neighbors.This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me onhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would preferinformation that is well documented  with sources given  about specificinstances of governmental abuses.

We grewup in an age of miracles    Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles nuclear energy  computers  flights to the moon.  But these weremiracles of our parents doing.  For a decade and more the punditshave told us    youve lost it    The  me  generation is onlyliving on the accomplishments of the past.     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  Welisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Livinghistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tellof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe asGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his teams work   and yes struggle  to build this nations Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.     What stories can we tell   Blurry eyed telescopes   Thousanddollar toilet seats   Even our space launch vehicles hearken onlyof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.Schrievers ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that thebest new space lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman andPoseidon ballistic missiles.     Well   The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents  Weve listenedto your stories.  Weve caught your enthusiasm and can do spirit. And weve learned from your achievements   and your mistakes.  Letme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetusbehind this history   Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatestengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Yourinsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM   later incorporatedinto todays most successful launch vehicle   The Delta.     You told us in the 60s that a new form of launch vehicle   asingle stage reusable rocket   can and should be built.  Youadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple  as areall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  Youconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weldits components into place.  Most important   you reminded us of aprime engineering principle   undoubtably one you learned from thegeneration before you   the generation that built transcontinentalaviation in the 1920s and 30s   build a little and test a littleand Max  you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner whostarted this program for the SDI.     Douglas Aircraft didnt start with a DC 10.  They didnt evenstart with a DC 3.  Our grandfathers built a little  tested alittle   even sold a little and made a little money   before theymoved on to the next step.  They didnt take a decade or morebefore putting the first  rubber on the road.   Max Hunter   youdidnt take ten years to build Thor  and by God were not going totake ten years to show that low cost  single stage  reusableaerospace transportation is real.     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  sameteam here today but a few years to show through the StrategicDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We   you and us  launched a series of satellites   The Delta experiments   in abouta year apiece.  This  more than anything else signaled ourcommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the SovietUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscoredthe importance of our work in bringing about a new internationalrelationship.     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place theframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for thenext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  Thissummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for thefirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next threeyears a reusable sub orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use spacerapidly  affordably  and efficiently as no other nation can.  Andyes   well make a little money off it too      Then   and only then   well spend another three years tobuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC 3 ofspace will be a reality   We may even be able to use some of therocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts tocounter SDI merge to power mankinds next step to the stars      To be sure  we must guard against the temptations to leap tothe final answer.  Robert Goddards first rockets werent SaturnVs   If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extradollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbitalsystem   we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed theway.  Three years and a cloud of dust   in our case rocketexhausts.  There is no short cut.  If we expect to reshape theworld again   we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks athand      This project is real.  The torch of American technologicalgreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine isAmerican.  Lets go fly it

To get emergency medical care  anyone so insured   must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital    you must notify Blue Cross  or they will refuse to pay your bills.   In an emergency  where you must be treated before notifying them    you must inform them within 24 hours or  if you are unable to do   so for medical reasons  the hospital must. Failing to do so within   24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need   your card to notify them  and without the card  the hospital certainly   wouldnt know they had to.  Therefore  you are required to carry   the card at all times  or do without emergency medical coverage.      Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on the   head and your wallet  with your insurance card  is stolen.  This happened to   me  and it took six months to sort the mess out.  These sorts of plans sound   nice at first  but in the end they just create a lot of paperwork and   bureaucracy to deal with all the checking and filing they involve.

I thought there were 3 types of cones  equivalent to RGB.    Youre basically right  but I think there are just 2 types.  One is  sensitive to red and green  and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow.   This is why the two most common kinds of color blindness are red green and  blue yellow.    Yes  I remember that now.  Well  in that case  the cones are indeed color sensitive  contrary to what the original respondent had claimed.	Im not sure who the  original respondent  was but toreiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum  justas _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum  bluegreenin our case  reddish in certain amphibia   just as the hoseshoe crab_Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion ofthe spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelengthspecificity with being color sensitive  however the two are notsynonymous.	So in sum and to beat a dead horse 	 1  When the outputs of a cone are matched for number ofabsorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.	 2  Cones are simply detectors with different spectralsensitivities and are not any more  color sensitive  than are rods ommatidia or other photoreceptors.	 3  Color vision arises because outputs of receptors whichsample different parts of the spectrum  cones in this case  are processed centrally .   The handwave is intentional 	Ive worked and published research on rods and cones for over10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can  detect color is frustrating.

Dumbest Driver Action,Organization  Corporation for Open SystemsDistribution  usa Lines  41In  C5Dq2n.5uB news.cso.uiuc.edu  mwbg9715 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu  Mark Wayne Blunier  writes  jimf centerline.com  Jim Frost  writes   I wish I had the figures with me to back me up  but I recall  statistics showing that women tended to have more accidents than men  but the damage was generally quite minor.  Men had fewer but far more  expensive accidents.  The rate of total vehicle destruction was   significantly  higher for men than women  particularly in the younger  male age groups.  IMHO social considerations are probably the strongest influence here   possibly more so than any difference between the sexes.  Social  influences often affect the type of car thats bought and the  situations the car is used in  and the type of car and driving  situations have a major effect on accident risk.  Thus if society  expects you to buy a Mustang and race it on the street youre more  likely to do it  and our society expects that of males more than  females. I agree with some of your social influences  such as driving conditions  but lets get real here.  Guys dont drag race becuase there expected too  we do it becuase its fun    and we find out whose car is faster .   Guys drive different than women becuase there men.  When a driver is   driving unusually  I can usually figure out if it is a male or female driver without looking at the driver. Social influences may give a person more reason to buy a vehicle that has a certain amount of character which he or she would like associated with.  Do you change your driving habits when no one is around Sheesh  I dont know what kind of women they have where you guys live but there are some ladies here who will blow your doors off. Or at leastthey will try to  but we just cant let the youngsters get too uppitywith us old folks    .  My  .02. Mark B.  jim frost  jimf centerline.com Bob

Curcio  jpc philabs.philips.com  responded to my drivel      steveg cadkey.com  Steve Gallichio  writes         I still am surprised that no one has tried giving away the goodies at the end    of the game. The two problems with that  of course  are that you would want    to make sure the first people in the building would be assured of getting    them  probably redeemable vouchers   and that the building managers want to    avoid at all costs delaying people as they leave the building  if  for    instance  the goodies are given to people as they exit.      I went to the New Jersey Devils Carvel Ice Cream Puck Night  tm  last year to   see the beloved Bruins play.  The pucks were given out at the end of the game.   I could just imagine what would have happened late in the third if the Bruins   were winning....    It figures  after I posted the first article  I found out that the Whalers are  going to be using coupons for the the giveaway on Friday Night. I believe that  is is the  Some Big Corporation  Probably a Bank  Flying Disk Night.  I think  that we could all see the potential for danger here...        All in all  I have seen a whole bunch of giveaways land on the ice  and it      never ceases to amuse me. Im just thankful for the players that no one has      yet to sponsor Lead Pipe Night at any arenas...      Thats probably because they couldnt find anyone to sponser it... Maybe USS   could sponser the Pittsburgh Penguins US Steel Steel Rod Night   close enough     Naah  itd probably bounce off of Jay Caufield.     SGI was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local countrystation sponsored a kazoo giveaway.  After a particularly bad call by theunderexperienced ECHL ref  it was Kazoostorm time down on the ice.  Ithought this was a pathetic display by the fans  but they were rightfullyunhappy.Jason

Alan H.

Basil  do you know of any evidence that would support   this I agree with Shai   there are many references to Israeliplans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard evidence.  I had mentioned before that there is a reportcommissioned by the UN to study the Litani river  it is still in draft form.  The Israeli govt also commissioneda study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe.The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon flows Southward  then West across South Lebanon anddischarges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre.There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzanithat start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.  The most mentioned plan was one that would divert waterfrom the Litani into these  then the water would flownaturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidenceof any diversion structure  which would need to be at least3 km long .  The area is mountainous  inaccessible andoccupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent reports of the existence of any diversion structure there.Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wellstapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on theIsraeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeedunder use they would be costly to operate  high energy costs  and the Lebanese and Israeli govt should agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifersas part of an overall peace plan and the bilateralnegociations on  regional issues .  The fact that we havebeen at war all this time has led to the current stateof affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers iscompletely unregulated.Basil      Hasan             Shai Guday                Stealth bombers    OS Software Engineer        Thinking Machines Corp.  	the winged ninjas of the skies.

There is an anecdote about ArmeniansTroglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.The image conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and independence  they have always been subservient  and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during World War II. Belligerence  genocide  back stabbing  rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal they tried to cover up the cold blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.And  you dont pull nations out of a hat.Source  Walker  Christopher   Armenia  The Survival of a Nation.

It was for the purpose of establishing a state  not an  exclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive  it would not have  400 000 arab citizens.Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of Israel right after it was formed.   	And no  I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile  action.  When someone wants to buy land  and someone else is willing  to sell it  at a mutually agreeable price  then that is commerce.  It  is not a hostile action leading to war.No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard aboutanti trust in the business world.Since we are debating the legality of a commercialtransaction  we must use the laws governing the guidelinesand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI TRUST law saysthat  while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose ofinvesting  you can not acquire a large number of thoseshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do soonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had somedesigns  they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in theold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi ethnic  multi religious society  accepting the jews as neighbourswas no different  just another religion. Plus they paid fairmarket value  etc... They did not know they were victims ofan international conspiracy.  Im not a conspiracy theoristmyself  but this one is hard to dismiss .  As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace  maybe.  However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish  state  where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of  the land.  Living in peace is meaningless unless it means  living  WITH  someone else  as equal. For a native arab  this   does not leave many options. 	Oh  you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens   The arabs who stayed are now citizens  with as much right to choose who they vote for as the Jews.Again Adam  the devil is in the details. I dont want to geton a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says itsOK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 isa nice number that you can devide by 10  100 and besides  ithas an integer square root.  Those palestinians who stayed  actually stayed despite of what   happened  and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless  and ineffective minority.  If I were wrong  youd have Israel recall all the  palestinian refugees  were talking millions . After all   they are civilians.  	Huh   The people who left  did so voluntarily.  There is no reason for Israel to let them in.Do you actually believe this  My experience tells me thatevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home  inPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as anescape from hell  so to speak . I know none that agrees withyou. Did you sample their opinions  I know you dont care just being rethorical.  Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it  had to maintain a democratic facade  to keep the western aid  flowing . 	Israel got no western aid in 1948  nor in 1949 or 50...It still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how is granting citizenship a facade Dont get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democraticwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group  Jews .Israel probably had a few options after 1948  ethniccleansing Serbian style  and deserve the wrath of theinternational community  or make the best out of a no wincondition  show the world how good Israel is towards thebad arabs. Personaly  Ive never heard anything about thearab community in Isreal. Except that theyre there.  Soyes  theyre there. But as a community with history androots  its dead.  	Tell me something  Sam.  What makes land  arab   How shall I explain  Its a contract between the man and the land.  Control isnt it. The Ottomans ruled 400 years  and then left with barely a trace.  The concept of Land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic West.  It is partly the concept of le sol natal  native soil.  I know that jews had previous history in the region  but none in recent memory.  Im talking everyday life not archeology. 	Try again  you tell me what its isnt  but you fail to  establish what it is. 	Also  Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200 1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  Does that make the land Jewish I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was notpredominant in Palestine in recent history. I have noproblem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it werepredominantly Jewish.

Most of the content of the White House announcements wasin what was  not  said.  It gives us almost nothing of value  threatens totake away a lot  and does it with a sincere smile on its face and the nice friendly word  Management .			      FACT SHEET		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENTThe first thing it doesnt say is  Were giving you stronger encryption .what it says is    the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust   than the current government standard  but also permits escrowing of   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break  At best  it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break  since theyneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute force searchfor the other 40 bit key.Similarly  it didnt say  Were making encryption is commercially available. because encryption  is  already commercially available  includingforms the NSA may not be able to break  like triple DES or IDEA.And phone companies could offer DES based systems  now  if they wereconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.The next thing it didnt say is  Were making encryption legal  because of course encryption  has always been  legal  and thePresident cant change the First Amendment merely by decree.What it  did  say was 	In making this decision  I do not intend to prevent the	private sector from developing  or the government from approving 	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in	assuring both privacy and a secure key  escrow system.which clearly means  Were making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.Soon.  Once business buys into this. Another thing it didnt say is  Were going to ask Congress for moneyto do  lots  more wiretapping   because of course  theres a budget crisis and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.What it  did  say was    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to   the extent needed to preserve the governments ability to conduct   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure   law enforcement communications.  Further  the Attorney General   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.which means  Weve got money Congress cant control and were going tobuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON APPROVED CRYPTO thats what  preserve the governments ability to conduct ... surveillance  means.

Weighted        for population  the US has 57x as many handgun related deaths as the        UK.  And  no  the Brits dont make up for this by murdering 57x as        many people with baseball bats.   If you examine the figures  they do. Stabbing is favourite  closely   followed by striking  punching  kicking. Many more people are burnt to   death in Britain as are shot to death. Take at look and youll see for   yourself.  It means that very few people are shot to death in Great Britain.And Im sure that is a great comfort to the widows and children ofthose stabbed  beaten and burned to death. The real question is  Did the crime rate in England go down  after they enacted gun control laws   If you look at the rates before and after theirfirst such law in 1920  you will see no effect.

Where to find CHEAP LCD displays ,Organization  Netcom Online Communications Services  408 241 9760 login  guest Lines  32Sci.E E  netters I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working fine  I have ordered a PIC ICE  not vice versa  since the PICs are so cheap and low power  but I am having a devil of a time finding any LCD displays in the 6 8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I am looking for somthing in the range of  1 in quantities of about 1000 10 000.Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part number  or when they do look around for something in their line they find a  15 8 digit LCD.  Even Digikeys cheapest offering is  5 in quantity.I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole calculators for sale for  4.99  meaning the retailer probably buys it for  3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for  2.50 or so.  This  2.50 includes assembly labor  packaging  sales  transportation  import duties  the case and keyboard  the PC Board  the processor chip  the solar cell     and the LCD.  The LCD cant cost much.If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and or distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged. Joe Bettsbetts netcom.comP.S.

Are all truths also absolutes     Is all of scripture truths  and therefore absolutes          If the answer to either of these questions is no  then perhaps you can     explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths  and    which truths are absolutes.        The answer to both questions is yes.  Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me  an absolute is something that is constant across time  culture  situations  etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition   I think you do     Similarly  all truth is absolute.  Indeed  a non absolute truth is a    contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute   When it is always   true.  Obviously  if a  truth  is not always  true  then we have a   contradiction in terms.  Yes  I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term  always  israther deceptive  I admit.    A simple example   In the New Testament  sorry I dont have a Bible at work  and cant provide a reference   women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now  this is scripture.  By your definition   this is truth and therefore absolute.  Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However  discerningexactly what Jesus  Paul and company were trying to say is not always soeasy.  I dont believe that Paul was trying to say that all women shouldbehave that way.  Rather  he was trying to say that under the circumstancesat the time  the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility andcover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness towardothers.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derivedfrom absolutes.  For instance  it is absolutely right for Christians tostrive for peace.  However  this does not rule out trying to maintain worldpeace by resorting to violence on occasion.   Yes  my opinion.   Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.   And there are plenty of other examples.  Can you reconcile this Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However  exactly what thosetruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said  the Bible doespreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystalclear  at least to evangelicals .  Sometimes they are not so clear toeveryone  e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not  etc .  That islargely because sometimes  it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writersare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.    Its very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own  interpretation  is absolute.  God revealed his Truths to the world  through His Word.  It is utterly unavoidable  however  that some people whill come up with alternate interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted  especiallywhen it comes to matters of right and wrong.

Christian Extremist Kills Doctor ,Organization  Florida State UniversityDistribution  naLines  23 David R. Sacco   dsav  andrew.cmu.edu  writes      Not to be too snide about it  but I think this Christianity must     be a very convenient religion  very maliable and suitable for     any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants     to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and     reinterpret the bits that dont match with ones desires.  It     is  in fact  so convenient that  were I capable of believing     in a god  I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.     The only difficulty left then  of course  is picking which sect     to join.  There are just so many.           Dean Kaflowitz    Yes  Christianity is convenient.

Does Just justifiable War exist ,Organization  AI Programs  University of Georgia  AthensLines  32Some thoughts  A. On the non pacifist side   1  Killing to defend the innocent may be  if anything  _more_ justifiablethan killing in self defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek  but I haveno right to turn someone elses. 2  It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism  He would havemade His position more explicit.  He didnt tell the centurion to leave thearmy  for instance  and the NT is full of military metaphors. B. On the pacifist side   1  Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But its not clearwhether they were objecting to war _per se_  or objecting to Roman policies. 2  In modern warfare  it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only atcombatants.  Bombing  both conventional and nuclear  kills lots of civilians. 3  Its hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become availableto the general public.Please  NO EMAIL REPLIES    this is meant as a contribution to a publicdiscussion  and anyone wanting to reply should also reply publicly.

MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY,Organization  Youngstown State Youngstown Free NetLines  224 With Franks permission  I have added some information here  and inone case changed the order of his contributions  in order to clarifythe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are basedprimarily on William Ruschs historical summary in  The TrinitarianControversy   Fortress.  Im going to save this as an FAQ.    clh MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY  SECOND CENTURYThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important  because they set up muchof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr  Aristides Athenagoras  Tatian  and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the Apologists .  Their theology has often been described as  Logostheology .  Based strongly on wording in John  they took more or lessa two phase approach.  Through eternity  the Logos was with theFather  as his mind or thought.  This  immanent Word  became expressed  as God revealed himself in history  ultimately in Jesus.Thus Jesus full distinction from the Father only became visible inhistory  though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of thefinal orthodox position  but in a form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal withthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However hewas uncomfortable with the two stage approach.  He still viewed God asone personage  with distinctions that did not become fully visibleexcept through his process of self revelation  the  economy  .  Thedistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasizedthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus views shouldprobably be called  economic trinitarianism   though that term isnormally used  as below  to refer to later developments.THIRD CENTURY  clh Dynamic Monarchianism Source  TheodotusAdherents  Paul of Samosota  Artemon  Socinus  Modern UnitariansPerception of Gods Essence  The unity of God denotes both oneness of natureand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore areconsubstantial with the Fathers divine essence only as impersonal attributes.The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus  but he was not God in the strictsense of the word.Perception of Gods Subsistence  The notion of a subsistent God is a palpableimpossibility  since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. Thediversity of God is apparent and not real  since the Christ event and thework of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God  not toa hypostatic union.Asignation of Deity Eternality  Father  Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal  self existent  andwithout beginning or end. Son  A virtuous  but finite  man in whose life God was dynamically present ina unique way  Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified. Holy Spirit  An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternalityis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.Criticism s   Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelationconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of theHoly Spirit  thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblicaldoctrine of salvation. In summary  this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianismat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seenas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in theChurch.    clh  Modalistic Monarchianism Source  PraxeasAdherents  Noatus  Sabellius  Swedenborg  Scleiermacher  United Pentecostals Jesus Only Perception of Gods Essence  The unity of God is ultra simplex. He isqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  Thisessence may be designated interchangeably as Father  Son  and Holy Spirit.They are different names for but identical with the unified  simplex God. Thethree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.Perception of Gods Subsistence  The concept of a subsistent God is erroneousand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of Gods modalistic manifestingof himself. The paradox of a subsisting  three in oneness  is refuted byrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three differentnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.Asignation of Deity Eternality  Father  Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation ofthe only unique and unitary God Son  Full deity eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being anothermode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same Godmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role  incarnation . Holy Spirit  Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which theone God  in temporal sequence  manifested himself pursuant to the role ofregeneration and sanctification.Criticism s   Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitariandeficiencies  this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Itsconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for suchsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christs baptism. Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There areactually two slightly different groups included  Noetus and hisfollowers  and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.Sabellius followed him  and attempted to use some features of economicTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately information about Sabellius comes from a century later  and thereseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra.   clh   Ive moved the following description to be with the otherthird century views.  It originally appeared near the end.    clh  Economic  Trinitarianism Source  Hippolytus  TertullianAdherents  Various  neo economic  TrinitariansPerception of Gods Essence  The Godhead is characterized by triunity  Father Son  and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especiallycomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.Perception of Gods Subsistence  Subsistence within the Godhead is articulatedby means of such terms as  distinction  and  distribution  dispellingeffectively the notion of separateness or division.Asignation of Deity Eternality The equal deity of Father  Son  and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated inobservation of the simultaneous relational operational features of theGodhead. Co eternality  at times  does not intelligibly surface in thisambiguous view  but it seems to be a logical implication.Criticism s   Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of therelational aspect of the Trinity. Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus  asmentioned above.  As with them  the threeness is visible primarily inthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However theydid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehowpresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks ofthe Father  Son  and Holy Spirit as being three that are one insubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentiallyorthodox  but with less developed philosophical categories.    clh  Origen  developing further an approach started by Clement  attemptedto apply neo Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the termsof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion  he sees the Son as amediator  mediating between the absolute One of God and the pluralityof creating beings.  The Son is generated  but he is  eternallygenerated .  That is  the relationship between Father and Son iseternal.  It cannot be said that  there was once when he was not   aphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries .  Having the Sonis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are describedas separate  hypostases   though this may not have quite the meaningof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union isone of love and action  but there is some reason to think that he mayhave used the term homoousios   of the same substance  .  The HolySpirit is also an active  personal substance  originated by the Fatherthrough the Son.  Origens intent is trinitarian  not tritheistic  buthe pushes things in the direction of separateness.FOURTH CENTURY  clh Subordinationism   often called Arianism   clh  Source  AriusMajor Adherents  Modern Jehovahs Witnesses  and several other lesser knowncultsPerception of Gods Essence  The inherent oneness of Gods nature is properlyidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreetentities who do not share the divine essence.Perception of Gods Subsistence  The unipersonal essence of God precludes theconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead.  Threeness in oneness  is self contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.Asignation of Deity Eternality  Father  The only one  unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning. Son  A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence. Holy Spirit  A nonpersonal  noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewedas an influence  an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.Criticism s   It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respectingthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewiseasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father  Christ and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. Note also that in most versions of this view  the Son is not fullyhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes thisview from adoptionism.    clh  Orthodox Trinitarianism Source  AthanasiusAdherents  Basil  Gregory of Nyssa  Gregory of Nazianzus  Augustine  ThomasAquinas  Luther  Calvin  Contemporary orthodox ChristianityPerception of Gods Essence  Gods being is perfectly unified and simplex  ofone essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father  Son  and HolySpirit. The three persons are consubstantial  coinherent  co equal  and co eternal.Perception of Gods Subsistence  The divine subsistence is said to occur inthree modes of being or hypostases. As such  the Godhead exists  undivided individed persons.  This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperationin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.Asignation of Deity Eternality In its final distillation  this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father  Son and Holy Spirit as co equal and co eternal in the Godhead with regard to boththe divine essence and function.Criticism s   The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent inhuman language and thought itself  the impossibility of totally describing theineffable mystery of  three in oneness.  At least in the 4th Cent  there were several different approaches  allof which fit the description here  and all regarded as orthodox  but whichare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respondto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origens thought a bittoo far  to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In generalthe East tended to take an approach based on Origens  and it was hardto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance wasbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians  Gregory of Nyssa andGregory of Nazianzus  among others.  While starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that onemust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Councilof Constantinople  in 381  to get wide agreement on the idea ofthree hypostatese and one ousia.    clh Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_  by H.

Just my 0.02cents thought....   Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to CMOS is set to usually wait states  regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  Nomotherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed  unless you callfailing as a sort of auto sense.  This is how you can sometimes use slower  RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states toaccomodate the slow RAM  in which case  all memory will run at thatslower rate  or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that theslower RAM will act like faster RAM and you wont crash.Putting faster RAM in wont speed things up unless you tell the machineit has faster RAM.  Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.JimL                                                                       Mailer address is buggy   Reply to  jiml strauss.FtCollinsCO.NCR.comJames Lewczyk                                   1 303 223 5100 x9267NCR MPD Fort Collins  CO             jim.lewczyk FtCollinsCO.NCR.COM

Torah commands that this be observed on the day following  the Sabbath of Passover week.   Sunday by any other name in modern  parlance.   Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection  on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured   Why jump it all  over the calendar the way Easter does   Why not just go with the Sunday  following Passover the way the Bible has it   Why seek after unbiblical  methods    In fact  that is the reason Easter  jumps all over the calendar   Passsoveritself is a lunar holiday  not a solar one  and thus falls over a widepossible span of times.  The few times that Easter does not fall during orafter Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox the beginning of spring. more deletions            So what does this question have to do with Easter  the whore  goddess    I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that  whore out of the discussion.   Your obsession with the term  whore  clouds your argument.   Whore  isa value judgement  not a descriptive term. more deletions Overall  this argument is an illustration of the  etymological fallacy  see J.P. Louw  _Semantics of NT Greek_ .  That is the idea that the truemeaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  In fact  ourown experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up withhow it is _used_  not where it came from.  Very few modern people wouldmake any connection whatsoever between  Easter  and  Ishtar.   If DanielSeagard does  then for him it has that meaning.

Used BMW Question           ,Organization  Northeastern Ohio Universities College of MedicineLines  32I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  Thedesign was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhatofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuitdifficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  Thesecondary purpose  acutally the primary purpose from the standpointof practicality  was to distributed the writes so as to avoidexceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used.The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effectat a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the readingby bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for anautomobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH inoperation.

post,Organization  Kulikauskas homeLines  30jono mac ak 24.rtsg.mot.com  Jon Ogden  writes   My advice is this   If you know someone that you have the hots for who is  NOT a Christian  befriend them and try to develop just a friendship with  them.  At the same time  witness and share the gospel with them  not so  that you can date them  but so that they can be saved.  Once they become a  Christian  then it is quite possible to let the relationship progress  beyond friendship.  However  if they dont accept Christ  you still have a  good friendship and you havent wasted a lot of emotional energy and gotten  hurt.While I agree with most of Jon says  I deleted those parts  of course   I have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a  just friends level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction.  When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.  Ive had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldnt date non Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state.  This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship.  I dont think it would work exactly this way for most people.  However  its important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction.  Jayne Kulikauskas  jayne mmalt.guild.org
Do we need the clipper for cheap security ,Organization  InterCon Systems Corporation   Herndon  VA  USALines  68Distribution  worldReply To  amanda intercon.com  Amanda Walker NNTP Posting Host  chaos.intercon.comX Newsreader  InterCon TCP Connect II 1.1pmetzger snark.shearson.com  Perry E. Metzger  writes   If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses  obviously one   could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors. I agree.  So why is Cylink the only  and expensive  game in town Note  I think Cylink is great  and if my boss would double my salary  Id buy a bunch of their stuff   .One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability  at a higher degree of security than we currently have in non proprietary voice encryption systems.This means it will be cheaper than anyones proprietary scheme  and easier to deploy.  This is  of course  either a bug or a feature depending on how you look at it   .  Indeed  even without special engineering  you can construct a good   system right now. A standard codec chip  a chip to do vocoding  a DES   chip  a V32bis integrated modem module  and a small processor to do   glue work  are all you need to have a secure phone.Great   Where can I buy it Another note  If  Clipper  increases the incentive to bring stronger encryption to the mass market  all the better.  Its far overpriced at the moment.  Yes  cheap crypto is good    but we dont need it from the government.I dont care where we  need  to get it from  I care where we  can  get it from  and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.   Indeed  were it not for the government doing everything possible to   stop them  Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to   the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for the   NSA and company  cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it   is  they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for   them  Im sure cheap secure phones would be out right now. You can build them right now as long as you dont want to export  a restriction I firmly oppose .  The only thing stopping people from making cheap encryption is greed  they want a lock on the market.  They arent the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones   keeping cheap crypto out of peoples hands. When they hand you a   clipper chip  what you are getting is a mess of pottage    your prize   for having traded in your birthright. Oh  come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone  IS NOT  a substitute for a Cylink phone  or a STU III.  Its a substitute for the  voice scramblers  advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.  Are we getting cheaper crypto   for ourselves  No  because the market would have provided that on its   own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.I disagree.  Modulo ITAR  its not the government that has sabotaged the market.  Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in   exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography  Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right Amanda WalkerInterCon Systems Corporation

Justas examples last night  I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in thehead  which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens Scott  and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Ofcourse he wasnt called for that. Isnt kicking an automatic matchpenalty and 10 game suspension  I think Glenn Anderson got one a fewyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. Theres no doubt inmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. Hes alsovery good.How about that Tocchet head butt  Is there an automatic susppension thatgoes along with a  non kicking  match penalty  I cant remember anymore.Oh  the playoffs should be fun Ralph

Skipjack      has 2 80 possible keys.          We dont yet know if all 80 bits count.   That doesnt worry me at all  theyre not going to cheat at something   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key input pairs into the   chip  then try flipping random key bits  and see what happens to the   output.  We already know what  should  happen    about half the output   bits should vary  on average  from a 1 bit key change or input change.   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem  it might be the case that   some of the bits are much less powerful than others  in the sense that   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast    DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible  the 50  output   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again  though  I dont think   NSA is going to cheat that crudely  theyre likely to get caught.Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47  andnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This systemmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would nowonly have 2 79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bitswouldnt turn up anything interesting.   Remember that theyve promised to let a committee of outside experts see   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES like  a biased   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb  butIm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancywhich was well hidden  but would still make an exhaustive key searchtake far less than 2 80 encryptions. I dont believe your claim thatthe real keysize can be verified externally.							Andy Latto							andyl harlequin.com"
Lindbergh and the moon  was Why not give  1G ,Organization  MDSSCLines  60jbh55289 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu  Josh Hopkins  writes  mancus sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov  Keith Mancus  writes   cook varmit.mdc.com  Layne Cook  writes     The  25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit    of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers. But I strongly suspect    that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more    was at stake than  25 000. Could it work with the moon  Who are the    far sighted financial backers of today      The commercial uses of a transportation system between already settled   and civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.  The correct analogy is not with aviation of the 30s  but the long  transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  Lindberghs flight took place in 27  not the thirties.   Of course  sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the factthat far more aeronautical development took place in the 30s.  For muchof the 20s  the super abundance of Jennies and OX 5 engines held down theindustry.  By 1926  many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retiredand Whirlwind had their power weight ratio and reliability up to the pointwhere long distance flights became practical.  Its important to note thatthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927   Lindbergh Chamberlin and Levine  and Byrds _America_.   When its time to railroad you railroad.   It didnt require govt to fund these as long as something was known about  the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice  some were govt  funded  some were private. Could you give examples of privately funded ones   Not off the top of my head  Ill have to dig out my reference books again.However  I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry theNavigators Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money andmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then beshared.  But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount  of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff. A person who puts up  X billion for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done than because they expect to make money off the deal.  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire aMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporationscan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes  human powered aircraft  Orteigs prize  Lord Northcliffes prize for crossing the Atlantic  won in1919 by Alcock and Brown  were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required werewithin the reach of individual inventors  and the prize amounts were wellwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that onlya govt could afford to set up a  1B  prize for any purpose whatsoever.  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply bytaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a planethat could take off and fly the profile would be handed  3B  no questionsasked.

Lambrou  writes  What about Cyprus   The majority of the population is christian  but  your fellow Turkish friends DID and STILL DOING a good job for you  by cleaning the area from christians.All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece  someday  whatever the cost to theparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15  1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios.Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army  Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island  Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. The release of Nikos Sampson  a member of EOKA  National Organizationof Cypriot Fighters  and a convicted terrorist  shows that theenosis mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should notforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turksin Cyprus  committed murder to achieve this goal  and tried todestroy the islands independence by annexing it to Greece. Ofcourse  the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.

On the night of the 24th  of December  1963 my wife Feride Hasanand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora  her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.Ayshes  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sittinghaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos Riverdirection started to riddle the  house  sounding like heavy rain.Thinking  that   the  dining room  where  we   were  sitting  wasdangerous  we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thoughtwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid inthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. Wewaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor  was standingin the bath with her three children Murat  Kutsi and Hakan in herarms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.Greeks had  come in and were  combing  every corner of  the housewith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heardvoices saying  in  Greek   You want Taksim eh    and then bulletsstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three childrenfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks who broke  into the bathroom  emptied  their guns on us  again. Iheard one of the Majors children moan  then I fainted.When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later  I saw  Mrs. Ilhan andher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of theneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But whathad happened to my wife  Then I remembered and immediately ran tothe  toilet  where   in  the doorway   I saw  her  body. She  wasbrutally murdered.In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying Help  help. Is  there no one to save us    I became terrified. Ithought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was notdead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myselfunder the double bed.An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. Mymouth was dry   so I came out  from under the bed  and drank somewater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to thebathroom  which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There Ioffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe   her daughter and Mrs.  Novber whowere all wounded.We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  oclock in  the morning.  Ithought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and neededto be taken  to hospital. Finally  as we could  walk  Mrs. Novberand I  went  out into the street hoping to  find help  and walkedas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.There  we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we wereoperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that therewere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.Ayshe and her daughter.After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane toAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  monthstreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus Greeks arrested me at the Airport.All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during mydetention. They then released me. ON FOOT INTO CYPRUSS DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTERWe went tonight into the sealed off Turkish quarter of Nicosia inwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last fivedays.We  were the  first  Western  reporters there   and  we saw  someterrible sights.In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2  Irfan Bey Sokagi  we made our wayinto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  Achilds bicycle lay in a corner.In the  bathroom  looking  like a group  of waxworks   were threechildren piled on top of their murdered mother.In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in thehead.This  we  were told  was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whosefamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.Today was five days later  and still they lay there.Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE   From the  DAILY EXPRESS   ...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infantchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...

IL GIARNO  Italy   THEY ARE TURK HUNTING  THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM. Discussions start in London  in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people abandoning homes  land  herds  Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This  time  the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to  cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors. Article by Giorgo Bocca  Correspondent of Il Giorno Date  14 January 1964 DAILY HERALD  London  AN APPALLING SIGHTAnd when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight.Apart from the walls  they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bombattack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brickand concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberatelyfired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in  I found a twistedmass of bed springs  childrens conts and cribs  and ankle deep greyashes of what had once been chairs  tables and wardrobes.In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios  a mile away  I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. Fromthis village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither villagedid I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house. DAILY TELEGRAPH  London   GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the Turkish Sector of Nicosia  as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios  13 miles away  were brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three  more bodies  including one of a woman  were discovered nearby but could not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to  locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.Serdar Argic                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.

Lindbergh and the moon  was Why not give  1G ,"Organization  University of Illinois at UrbanaLines  42mancus sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov  Keith Mancus  writes  cook varmit.mdc.com  Layne Cook  writes    All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race  i.e.  1G to the first 1 year    moon base  is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace   development before. The  25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of    Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.   But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to    realize that much more was at stake than  25 000.   Could it work with the moon  Who are the far sighted financial backers of    today    The commercial uses of a transportation system between already settled  and civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the 30s  but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.Lindberghs flight took place in 27  not the thirties. It didnt require govt to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice  some were govt funded  some were private.Could you give examples of privately funded ones  But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However  theconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons  I suspect.  Im not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindberghs flight.  Modern analogies  such as the prize for ahuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economicbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developedand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up   X billionfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it donethan because they expect to make money off the deal.

This is not to take anything away from Jaro  who had a  decent year  although it didnt live up to the expectations of some .Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman styleplayer.  He plays hard at all times  doesnt disregard his defensiveresponsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing hisice time.Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a  me first  attitude.This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.Throughout the year  Francis consistently recieved more ice time thanJagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject  I am prettysure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.

Sherzer  writes... In article  17APR199316423628 judy.uh.edu  wingo cspara.decnet Fedex.Msfc.Nasa.Gov writes     I dont care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single  line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as  wrap at this university.    Dennis  I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of   . Customers included government  including NASA   for profit and non profit companies. All expected a wrap  usually called a fee . Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities  for profits  non profits  and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers  they charge a fee.  You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that postyou stated that the  wrap  was on top of and in addition to any overhead.Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true. Now  Im sure your a competent engineer Dennis  but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you dont understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isnt a flame  jsut a statement.Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doingwhat and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominumattack and you know it.   Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do. Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen anyorganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimatecosts  such as libraries and other things that must be there to supporta program and  wrap  as you originally stated it.You stated that wrapwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down yousay is not true. Which is it Allen    Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate. Go ask your   costing people how much fee they add to a project.    I did they never heard of it but suggest that  like our president did  that  any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.   Well there you are Dennis. As I said  they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer. As you have posted on this subject Allen  you state that wrap is over andabove overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get somenumbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and thenhowl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.  No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee  of the Overhead capital of NASA.    Integration  Dennis  isnt overhead.    Nothing that Reston does could not be dont  better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on. Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy ofReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who arecompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. Thereis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale projectthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for Apollo  Dennis  Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion     the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station. Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused itreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep yourbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out justhow wrong you really are. Maybe not  people like you believe exactly whatthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.   Kinda funny isnt it that someone who talks about a problem like this is  at a place where everything is overhead.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis  you will realize that integration isnt overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort. I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successfullarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating thatintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is calledleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility forthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadershipand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set upas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFCand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston tofinally say something about the problem  If they were on site and part of theprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen  but one thing I do know is thatfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of theturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you  It islack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack ofleadership from the White House  Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only asymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in yourefforts that you do not see this.  Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally  demanded change that caused the problems  Methinks that you are being   selective with the facts again.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldnt address the problems until the press published the story.   Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns  You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns  No  I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have happened in the first place.  If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost  of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your   friend  at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it  for a billion a year  if the wrap were gone . This merely points out a   blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.   You should know Dennis that NASA doesnt include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.    Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going  to have to do Allens math for him for a while. I will have little chance to  do so.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.  I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that isat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened  totallyignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra thathas grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative ofyour position.Dennis  University of Alabama in Huntsville

Dorin Dorin  Lets not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people  not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers  in the line of duty  were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists  though some might call them freedom fighters .And some of us call them murderous bastards  but whats in a name. Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Dont forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and theJust a damn minute  What history books did you read  I seem to recallthat there were a few British  Canadian  American  and Commonwealthsoldiers in France about that time. Perhaps you believe they were takinga vacation trip  Lebanese people are tired of being occupied  They are now turning to the only option they see as viable.

Turbo 040 interface   cards for the II  IIx  SE 30  IIcx  etc will probably be available  sooner  but if A UX compatibility is a requirement  it is probably  best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer.     An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE 30 is that just as with the 030 power cache  the 040 accelerator will plug intothe CPU socket  leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernetcard.  With DayStars upgrade path  its a no lose situation.                                                                         Earl D.

OtherwiseI agree  there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief.The Quran makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Publicor private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is notpunishable  there are some jurists who have gone against thistrend and insisted that apostasy is punishable  even by death    buthistorically they are the exception.Cursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of  Shatim .    I just borrowed a book from the library on Khomeinis fatwa etc. Lots of stuff deleted     And  according to the above analysis  it looks like Khomeinis offering  of a reward for Rushdies death in fact constitutes a criminal act  according to Islamic law.Please see my post under  Re  Yet more Rushdie  ISLAMIC LAW  .

In that case its rather ironic that they are doing so poorly on the commercial market.  Is there a single Titan III on order The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attemptto market it.  Theyre basically happy with their government business anddont want to have to learn how to sell commercially.A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  Theyd need to go aftermulti satellite launches  a la Ariane  and that complicates the marketingtask quite significantly.They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong timeto get them started properly.  If memory serves  the pad used for the MarsObserver launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that hadprevented launches from it for a year or so.There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  Sowas that stranded Intelsat  and at least one of its brothers that reachedorbit properly.   All work is one mans work.

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to use the net to directly advertise their products.The net is not  supposed  to be a dumping ground for free ads  butreserving it for tripe doesnt seem to be a significant improvement. In addition to improper etiquette  this product is a mailing list used for generating junk mail.  So   Either they target it well enough to pay for it  in other words they manage to send it to people who want the stuff  in which case itis junk only for the  rest  and the transaction costs are borneappropriately in this case  or they go bankrupt.  Seems fair to me. Am I correct in assuming this is improper  and if so  what can be  done to penalize such an improper use You could hold your breath.  You could kill offending messages asthey come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further but not until you turn blue. andy  
Do Analog Systems Need Ground Planes ,Organization  HP Lake Stevens  WALines  25engp2254 nusunix1.nus.sg  SOH KAM YUNG  writes  I understand the need for a ground plane in a digital system. However  I would like to know if such a ground plane is also necessary in an analog system.   Note  this ground plane will not be connected  except at one point  to the signal ground .  I keep getting conflicting answers over this. Does having a ground plane in an analog system help reduce noise also  My system only deals with low frequency signals  up to 100Hz only    .Well  one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends onwhat you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that needshielding rom other things   This shielding wont do much good for magneticfields  unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded like a Faraday cage.The flip side of the coin   if you are working with  very  high impedances you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.You arent likely to encounter this at 100Hz  but at 20kHz  it can be areal problem  one that bit me once .

Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold  turned pale  and lost 60  of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasnt that heavy  I was working hard but not at 100  effort.  I waited for a few  minutes  trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises  flyes  with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set  and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  Ill take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is  still  somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal    my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.  Im 34  vegetarian  and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen.  So that cant be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms  I hope  It likely has nothing to do with  chunks of plaque  but it sounds likeyou may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medicalattention  before  doing any more weight lifting.

Menangitis question,Article I.D.  pitt.19427Reply To  km cs.pitt.edu  Ken Mitchum Organization  Univ. of Pittsburgh Computer ScienceLines  42In article  C4nzn6.Mzx crdnns.crd.ge.com  brooksby brigham.NoSubdomain.NoDomain  Glen W Brooksby  writes  This past weekend a friend of mine lost his 13 month old daughter in a matter of hours to a form of menangitis.  The person informing me called it Nicereal Meningicocis  sp  . In retrospect  the disease struck her probably sometime on  Friday evening and she passed away about 2 30pm on Saturday. The symptoms seemed to be a rash that started small and then began progressing rapidly. She began turning blue eventually which was the tip off that this was serious but by that time it was too late  this is all second hand info. .  My question is  Is this an unusual form of Menangitis   How is it transmitted  How does it work  ie. how does it kill so quickly  There are many organisms  viral  bacterial  and fungal  which cancause meningitits  and the course of these infections varieswidely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age  in adultspneumococcus  the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common cause  while in children Hemophilus influenzaeis the most common cause.What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis inboth groups  but with lower incidence in infants. This organismis also called the  meningococcus   and is the source of thecommon epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized inthe press. Without prompt treatment  and even WITH it in some cases  the organism typically causes death within a day. This organism  feared as it is  is actually grown from the throatsof many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by differentways  but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. Rifampin  an oral antibiotic  is often given to family and contactsof a case of meningococcal meningitis  by the way.Sorry  but I dont have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitisis a huge topic  and sci.med cant do it justice. km
Why does US consider YIGAL ARENS to be a dangerous to humanity,Organization  USC Information Sciences InstituteLines  43NNTP Posting Host  grl.isi.eduIn reply to  ehrlich bimacs.BITNETs message of 19 Apr 93 14 58 49 GMTIn article  4815 bimacs.BITNET  ehrlich bimacs.BITNET  Gideon Ehrlich  writes    In article  ARENS.93Apr13161407 grl.ISI.EDU  arens ISI.EDU  Yigal  Arens  writes     Los Angeles Times  Tuesday  April 13  1993.  P. A1.    ........   The problem if  transffering US government files about Yigal Arens  and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal  or a local American law seemed to belong to some local american law  forum  not to this forum.  The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents  of those files.  So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us   1. Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous Im not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In anycase  that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim againstthe ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information thatwas gathered by state and or federal agencies in the course of theirstandard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer tothings such as  address and phone number  vehicle registration andlicense information  photographs  etc.  2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person  You should ask the ADL  if you want an authoritative answer.  My guessis that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage inpolitical criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this asagents of the Israeli government  or at least in agreement with them.At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on toIsraeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence  or attemptto influence  peoples access to jobs or public forums.  These matterswill be brought out as the court case unfolds  since California lawentitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As myprevious posting shows  California law entitles people to compensationeven in the absence of any specific consequences    just for the furtherdissemination of certain types of private information about them.

BTW  Atlantas .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good  the Braves really are. Their record is 6 3. Can you imagine the Phils  record if they were batting .188  hahahaha.

Boom  Dog attack ,Organization  The World Public Access UNIX  Brookline  MALines  33azw aber.ac.uk  Andy Woodward  writes  Better still  reverse this sequence  then hit the bugger under accelleration  to stabilise yourself . I hate things that attack me.  If the dog thinks you have run away  it has established dominance over  these funny noisy sheep things  and will attack every bike that comes  along for the fun of it. If you can hurt the bugger  it learns that it  is below bikes in the peck order  and you may have saved the life of a  future biker  whose evasive action to avoid the dog might otherwise put  him under a truck. Never avoid a dog for the dogs sake  only youre own.  I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logicto this approach. Its the bikers against the world and the dogs are just another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leatherboots    in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into yourattacking foot  and go for the gusto  If that dog doesnt retreat from thestreet with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you reallyhavent done your bit for all your fellow bikers. This also applies in cages.Sorry I cant go this far  A dog against and armored cage just doesntseem like a fair fight. If the dog is out of control  it is a menace to all road users  and no compunction should be felt if ensuring your safety means the destruction of  its.

New Testament Double Stan,Organization  Nyx  Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math CS dept.Lines  98   seanna bnr.ca  Seanna  S.M.  Watson  asks    What is the objection to celebration of Easter         The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. Easter  or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings  is the paganwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore  your question to me is  what isthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess    When phrasedthat way I suspect  or at least I would HOPE  that it becomes immeadiatelyapparent what my objection to  celebrating  her would be.    It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.       No  you are thinking perhaps of  Ressurection Sunday  I think.  Though Im not too crazy about the word  Sunday   but I certainly likethis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.      For that matter  stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet  The Feast ofFirst Fruits .  Torah commands that this be observed on the day followingthe Sabbath of Passover week.   Sunday by any other name in modernparlance.   Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrectionon the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured   Why jump it allover the calendar the way Easter does   Why not just go with the Sundayfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it   Why seek after unbiblicalmethods     I dont recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate   the resurrection  but it is the sole and only reason that   we are Christians  how could we not celebrate it        So what does this question have to do with Easter  the whoregoddess    I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep thatwhore out of the discussion.    If it is only the name which is a problem  I suggest that if   we are too concerned about etymology  there are a lot of   words we are going to have to drop.   As an aside  some   terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be   altered so that there are no negative definitions associated   with the word _black_  so as not to offend people of colour.        Yes  I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repavestreets with  Afro Canadiantop .   grin   I still think  blacktop  soundsbetter though.     As a short person  I hope they will also remove the definition    curt or surly  associated with my physical description.         Fine by me.  And while we are at it  the left handed people areboth  sinister  and  gauche  so we probably will have some objections fromthat quarter as well.    In Quebec French  the word for the celebration of the   resurrection is  Pa ques   this is etymologically related   to Pesach  Passover  and the pascal lamb.  So is the   French Canadian  mostly Roman Catholic  celebration better   because it uses the right name        Yes  that sounds much better to me.  Is there anyone out there wouldthinks that phrasing sounds worse     So from this I infer that there are different rules for   Christians of Jewish descent   What happened to  there is   neither Jew nor Greek  slave nor free  male nor female  for   all are one in Christ Jesus         Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me  was Philemons  slave returned to him   Were there different rules upon the slave than uponPhilemon   How about male and female   Are there different  rules  thatapply to them as well   Or if there is no more  male and female  can Adamand Steve get married to each other in your congregation   Yes  there aredifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation inMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.                                         I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion  as itseems repetitive  but this particular point is one that I believe isnew    the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.Id like to suggest that people think very carefully about thisargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days ofthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  SomeChristians prefer to refer to  first day    second day   etc.  Howeverthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The questionseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary showsas the derivation of a word  if what people mean by it and think whenthey use it is different.Indeed Id like to suggest that postings like this could themselves bedangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean thecelebration of Christs resurrection.  Postings trying to convincethem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess runthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.They are doing their best to  create  a linkage in peoples mindsbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  Its not clear thatthis is a healthy thing.  clh

Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is     repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just     for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone  Jew and Gentile     alike.      Jews wont agree with you  Malcolm.      Cheers    Kent         sandvik newton.apple.com. ALink  KSAND    Private activities on the net.A lot of people wont agree with me.  Thats their right and I respect that.However  to the point  Jews are also covered by the saving grace of JesusChrist.  There are Jews who have become Christians.This brings up another question I still have to ponder   why is there so much anti Semitism   Why do people hate Jews   I dont hate Jews.  I considerthem to be like anyone else  sinners we all are.
CACHE or Micronics EISA VLB Motherboard ,Organization  Indiana University Computer Science  BloomingtonLines  27This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am inthe process of purchasing an EISA VL Bus 486 DX2 66 computer and Ifound two places that sell machines that have what I want and have thesame price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard  thatsthe brand of the motherboard  with OPTI chip set  the other is Micron formerly Edge Technology  and they use the Micronics EISA VLBmotherboard.I said that this might be a silly question since I believe thatMicronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I neverheard of Cache  I am however leaning towards the Ares machine becausemy impression is that they are known for building good  solid machinesand they have good tech support  24 hr  7 days wk   and a betterwarrantee  2 years .  Micron  on the other hand  seems to haverecently aquired Edge Technologies and Im not sure how much I shouldtrust the company.I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine theclear choice   Does anyone know anything positive or negative abouteither company  Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards  Should Igo with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard  etc.Thanks very much in advance for any information.

Draw you own     conclusions.  Uh  Im afraid that your information is slightly out of date...PKWare   has obtained a license to export their program to the wholeworld    except a very limited list of countries...  Draw your ownconclusions   about the strength of the algorithm...     Sorry if I was less than clear.      I was referring to our own effortsto receive export permission from NSA for the PKZIP encryptionalgorithm  not to any effort on the part of Phil Katz or PKWare.I should point out that the original version of this algorithm wasdesigned by Roger Schlafly and that WE  meaning Roger and myself  weretwice denied an export license for it.  The second go round was justthis past fall.I had no knowledge of Phils attempts in this.  I do not even  know  forsure if he choose to implement the algorithm as it was designed byRoger  though I  believe  that was at least the case for versions priorto 2.0.  And then theres the question of key management.     And even if our applications were identical  there is no reason toassume the NSA would treat them that way.      mjm            Michael J.

Procomm Plus for windows problems    ,Organization  SDRCLines  14You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows thanin DOS   regardless of what communication software you are using.Try the following    1  Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.   2  Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UARTs  8250 or 16450        can only buffer one character internally.  The new UARTs  16550  can       buffer 16  which should be plenty for most situations.  You can run        windows msd.exe to find out what UART is on the machine.Ron

Please detail your complaints or e mail if         you dont want to post.  First century Greek is well known and         well understood.  Have you considered Josephus  the Jewish Historian          who also wrote of Jesus   In addition  the four gospel accounts         are very much in harmony.    Bill  I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what isprobably the weakest evidence.  What is probably the most convincing is the anti Christian literature put outby the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities ofdetailed arguments against Christianity  many of the arguments still being usedtoday.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity  not one denies theexistance of Jesus  only of his activities.  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of thegospels  especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as asource .    __L__     ___  Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub      o   kv07 iastate.edu         Iowa State University     ___  Math Department     ___  400 Carver Hall     ___  Ames  IA  50011 J  _____

WD40 will help  things that are seized due to rust but this is unlikely for a drain  plug.  You should be able to undo it with a spanner.  When it  loosens  it will probably become very loose and you will bash your  knuckles on the underside of the car   this is the price you must  pay for doing you own work.  No  thats the price you pay for not knowing how to use a wrench.  You want to pull the wrench towards you  away from painful knuckle splitting hard things.  If you cant pull it because things are in the way  push it with an open hand.I find this method much better myself  too  although I do reallyhate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and myhand both come crashing into my face.

That is not to  say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick  eg  disabled persons   but they arent in any position to use an  SHO anyway.     I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic  transmissions from all  performance type  cars  like the 5.0l  Mustangs  Camaros  and the like  wed cut down on the number of  accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans   but they have no business in performance cars  IMHO.    				James   I have to disagree with this.  I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4 speed auto w  overdrive  and it is really better that way.  Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power.  I live  in the Dallas area  and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic  here.  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to  a manual would be more fun.    Safety wise  an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be     shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here. Performance wise  I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0 Camaro w  a five speed.    All of this IMHO...   all of my HOs disagree with your HOs.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..detested it in the auto like i did any other time in the auto... .  Of course Dalls rush hours are nothing  from what i hear..if i lived in LA  i mightbe of a different persuasion.  And  just for the record  rarely do you shiftgears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th isgood up through around 80 90  most of the time  so you can just wind it out..its not going to hurt anything  and keeps it in the powerband anyway..only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th fairly rare unless you drive a ferrari or some such  id bet  or when you hit cruising speed where you feel comfortable or when my mother is sitting in the passanger seat complaining about how you wind her  poor little engine  waytoo hi    Just my HOs..DREW"

I should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis.Actually  there was very little to the book.  First of all looking atthe titles of her other books  I would personally consider her to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian like mysticismheavily influenced by eastern philosphies  great titles like _The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_ .However  other than the Chapter One into  theres nothing original biased  or even new this book.  It is basically a collection of previouslypublished works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindustories that Christ visited India and China  he was known as Issa  during the period from late teens to age 30.Conclusion   the book actually lets you come to your own view by presentinga summary of various published works and letters  all of which youcould verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works aswell.  Therefore  even if you think she is theologically warped  this book is a nice reference summary for the interested.

BATF FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today  4 19,Organization  The University of Texas at Austin  Austin TXLines  43NNTP Posting Host  louie.cc.utexas.eduroby chopin.udel.edu  Scott W Roby  writes  mikey ccwf.cc.utexas.edu  Strider  writes   According to an Australian documentary made in the year before the stand off  began  Koresh and his followers all believed he was Christ.  Koresh  had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound.   These were the  perfect children  resulting from the  great seed  of  his  magnified horn .  Ex members describe him in ways not dissimilar  to the way Jim Jones has been described.I dont know how accurate the documentary was  however  Koresh was neverconvicted of any crimes against children  nor was the BATF after him forchild abuse.  Their purview  in this case  is strictly in firearms violations so this information is irrelevant to the discussion. FBI agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background  checks.  Plus  those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain their  decisions in great detail to congress.  Why would the FBI want to fulfill  Koreshs own prophecy Those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain  something   but whethertheir answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know.  And whois left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled   It only holdsmeaning for the nine who survived.  Correction   The  FBI  said that two of the cult members said this  so far   no one else has been able to talk to them.

Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered  if anyone else had seen this.   As a followup  this is a co workers machine.  He has the latest 2.03 drivers. It only happens using the 1024x768x256 driver.  Sometimes it takes a minute or so for the cursor to wig out  but it eventually does in this mode.  I susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants.  I excluded a000 c7ff in the EMM386 line and in system.ini  The problem persisted. Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or its components. It is a 66mhz DX 2 Eisa bus with an Ultrastore  24xx   controller.  Ah well  I was hoping this was some kind of known problem or somebody had seen it before.

May I ask why   Its there not because the British want it there  NI is just one big expensive problem   its there because that is what the majority of the population of NI want.  Is there some problem with that The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps.There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have controlof NI  like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump  I wasappalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast . It is myunderstanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water   itd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain andthen stopped accepting the waste.

Fraering  writes    rls uihepa.hep.uiuc.edu  Ray Swartz  Oh  that guy again   writes        The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions.  These    are described by the inventor as exploiting the second order perturbations in a    three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the    earth moon sun system  where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to    allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow    down. The idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without    expending fuel  well just find the trajectory that makes it possible . The    originator of the technique said that NASA wasnt interested  but that Japan    was because their probe was small and couldnt hold a lot of fuel for    deceleration.

You are saying   Since    diseases are bad  the bad entity must have created it.   So    what would you say about acid rain  meteors falling from the    sky  volcanoes  earthquakes  and other QUOTE UNQUOTE  Acts    of God       I would say that they are not  acts of God  but natural  occurrences.It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was notthe result of the natural process of evolution  but rather an  act of God  and then in the same post say that these other processes  volcanos et al. are natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things arenatural processes and what are direct acts of God   How do you know thatGod doesnt cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purposein mind   It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature Ive seen inthe bible.    Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of    disease  evolution by random chance would have produced them since    humanity forsook Gods protection.  If we choose to live apart from    Gods law  humanity collectively   then it should come as no surprise    that there are adverse consequences to our  collective  action.  One    of these is that we are left to deal with disease and disorders which    inevitably result in an entropic universe.        May I ask  where is this collective bullcrap coming from     By  collective  I was referring to the idea that God works with  humanity on two levels  individually and collectively.  If mankind  as a whole decides to undertake a certain action  the majority of  mankind   then God will allow the consequences of that action to  affect mankind as a whole.Adam   Eve  TWO PEOPLE   even tho they had the honor  or so you christiansclaim  of being the first two  definitely do NOT represent a majority inthe billions and trillions  probably more  of people that have come afterthem.  Perhaps they were the majority then  but  I   and YOU  werentaround to vote  and perhaps we might have voted differently about what todo with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that ifyou have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like thesame kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists postinghere resorting to.

GETTING AIDS FROM ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES,Organization  University of California  BerkeleyLines  44Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  uclink.berkeley.edu   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture   needles.....Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who               themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely  not impossible  they will get AIDS         from acupuncture needles. Generally  even if accidently inoculated  the normalimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion. Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route...so its good business to advertise  disposable needlesused here.  These needles tend to be of a lower quality however  being poorly manufactured and too  sharp  in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint  that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      The risk here for hepatitis  HIV  etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk. Better quality needles tend to  slide  past vessels and            nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all solid when compared to their injection style cousins. In China  herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue  the diameter of the needle bore  will be injected into the body as it would  be in a typical  shot.  when the skin is puntured. On the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted  the skin tends to  squeeze  the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that havent been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion  tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. Of course in TCM...the bodys exterior is protected by the Wei  Protective  Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site.While Im fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion  I would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

R Teemu Selanne.....27    Compared to Kurri  Selannes points are too high  lets make it 25 or 26.No  Kurris points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel nne.   well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of   Markus Ketterer  the goalie   3 4 or the players listed above and luck. Theres   presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldnt be superstars at   the highest level but still valuable role players  however. My guess would be   that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. Wow  now  it looks like you dont like our players  What about guys like  Nieminen  Jutila  Riihijarvi  Varvio  Laukkanen  Makela  Keskinen and  even if he is aging  Ruotsalainen  The main difference between finnish and North  American players is  that our players tend to be better in the larger rink. The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe.  And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck  though they helped . I think that the main reason was  that the team worked well together.Thats true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North ame ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An averageeuropean player from Sweden  Finland  Russian or Tsech Slovakia is a better skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHLare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm leaguegame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldnt get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than inNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel nnes speed accentuates becauseof clumsy defensemen.I have to admit that the best players come from Canada  but those regularsarent as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeansare in the same level as the best north americans. except Lemieux is in theclass of his own . Tommi

I want to send aid to Russia.  Many other     conservatives do as well.         Yes  it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It  makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and  liberals prefer to cold war until you win  then nurse the enemy back to  health for another go around. Enemy   Sounds like thats the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative    always been commies  always will be.OK  I should have said  former  enemy.  I was being sarcastic about whatinterventionists want to do. I suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti West slogans coming from his opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of agun Have you considered a non interventionist policy   If market reform doeshappen  Russia will certainly get  private  capital at  private  risk tohelp their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the samereason.  If they dont reform  then our government will probablyconsider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than helpthem.Then theirs the ideological point.  We want to  win  Russia over toour type of government    a type where the rulers can rule without limitover everyones finances   Its like subsidizing the wealthy countries  Japan  Germany  etc.  with  free defense  and then trade warring with them because of the economic  competition.  Its like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying  bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke. Better to let them degenerate into civil war   Remember all those nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and  even if they prevent a civil war  most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries  like Ukraine.   I also cannot imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight  possibly nuclear. How does this affect us   Well  we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think wed feel something. A massive breakup of a country that spans 1 6th the planet is bound to have affects here.   Of course  there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies  or struggling democracies . If a  1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being  couldnt itbe raised voluntarilly   People already give over  100 billion a year tocharity.    I ask myself  what law could we pass to prevent government from doing  stupid  frivilous things with OUR money   Then I think  the Constitution  was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate  constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money  from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries   Seriously. Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid. My two  causes  are aid to Russia and a strong space program. Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale  we only have gridlock on a congressional scale.It seems instead of gridlock on any scale  we have aid to Russia expensive space programs  national charity that doesnt help the poor and probably  studies of drunken goldfish.  I think  limited  governmentis more key than how democratic it is. BTW  who is to decide stupid   This is just like those who want to impose their morals on others    just the sort of thing I thought Libertarians were against.That was an opinion  and libertarians are very big on free speech. Actually  my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue  and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim.If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you shouldbe VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money wouldyour fellow Russia aiders have to give to Russia if those you opposewerent using the same government machine to steal money from youand your group for causes you dont support  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.People have been saying that for hundreds of years. Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making. All the more reason to depend on the free market which can moreefficiently process information  than to depend on rulers for decisionson complex issues.

If the counter is made with standard TTL chips  all you should need to do is find the chip s  used for counting  figure out what mileage you want to put in  and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to low high  youd also have to know what the conventions are for low and high .  It might be a little more involved than this  but it shouldnt be beyond someone with a BSEE or BS EET. All the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using a  translation table  stored in ROM. Nobody is using discrete ICs to do these functions anymore if atall.  I doubt any of the Motor electronics had any to start with....Much less TTL.I can almost guarantee that itll a fruitless attempt to figure outhow BMW does it without breaking anything and invalidating anywarranty  on the car.

THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                           April 16  1993                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYThe President today announced a new initiative that will bringthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.The initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and securetelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.For too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth  privacy andlaw enforcement  previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information  it also can be usedby terrorists  drug dealers  and other criminals.A state of the art microcircuit called the  Clipper Chip  hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation  protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal  state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A  key escrow  system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2 keys   numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured  the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two  key escrow  data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The  Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology  theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition  respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryptions dual edge sword   encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry  but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the  Clipper Chip  and otherapproaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches  like the key escrow system  the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates           the privacy of our citizens  including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes           the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data  under proper court or other legal          order  when necessary to protect our citizens           the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace  and           the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries  the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high speed networks  information superhighways   will transmit video  images  HDTVprogramming  and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure  the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent  comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONSTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ    Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations A    No.   Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message A    They would have to obtain legal authorization  normally a     court order  to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts  which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q    Who will run the key escrow data banks A    The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point  the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key escrow data banks.Q    How strong is the security in the device   How can I be sure     how strong the security is   A    This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system  we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q    Whose decision was it to propose this product A    The National Security Council  the Justice Department  the     Commerce Department  and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President  the Vice President  and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q    Who was consulted   The Congress   Industry A    We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues  and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q    Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A    The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits  but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q    Who provides the  Clipper Chip  A    Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance      California  and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q    How do I buy one of these encryption devices  A    We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the  Clipper Chip  into their devices.     Q    If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed  would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices A    This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure  more convenient  and less expensive     than others readily available today  but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology  which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying   since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement      we will prohibit it outright   as some countries have     effectively done   nor is the U.S. saying that  every     American  as a matter of right  is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.   There is a     false  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is     an  either or  proposition.  Rather  both concerns can be      and in fact are  harmoniously balanced through a reasoned      balanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper     Chip  and similar encryption techniques.Q    What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration   A    It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans     privacy  help businesses to compete  and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q    Will the devices be exportable   Will other devices that use     the government hardware A    Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case by case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind  we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case by case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict   obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth  to Nazis who have    justly    punished the Jews for the killing Christ  as well as the other progroms   the   innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with  you shall not allow a   witch to live   the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades  the god fearing   men destroyed by the inquistion.

There is much to grieve.    randyVery interesting  but I also believe that you have presented amisleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacresand horrific injustices that you relate  rather they are the faultof people who misunderstand Jesus Christs message  and modifyit to suit their own beliefs and aims  rather than alter theirambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable inthe New Testament.  With every truthful and good message thatcarries authority or implied authority  comes the inevitablefact that some  many   people will understand it in a distortedway  with inevitable consequences.The Bibles message is that we are to love all people  andthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message ofrepentance  and of giving.  Unfortunately  all people havedeceitful hearts  and are capable of turning this messagearound and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.One of the problems is that you look at the world throughthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will findmany  many cases of massacres that were instigated bypeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not sayingthis to justify the massacres that were  but I am merelypointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that wewould have the same freedoms in the countries in which welive  if it wasnt for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion I wont name any here  though one comes to mind  whichwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate suchsubjects.Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst forpower  greed and hatred.  Please dont point the blame ata message which preaches fundamental giving and denial  inlove for others.Yours in Christ Andrew McVeighp.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presentedis  strangely enough  compatible with becoming a Christian.Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviourof the world  and especially Christians.  I praise God forJesus Christ  and the fact that we can doubt our beliefsand still come back to God and be forgiven  time and timeagain.       Andrew McVeigh

Depends on your area  in the city  nobody thinks about it...but at a mall orsomething near the suburbs  people do at least glance over.  Remember  analarm is only a deterent  not a prevention.  If a thief sees two cars he likes   one has an alarm and the other doesnt  hes obviously going to skipthe alarmed car and avoid the hassle.

Latest on Branch Davidians,Organization  University of MissouriLines  63In  Apr.22.00.55.06.1993.2048 geneva.rutgers.edu  aaron binah.cc.brandeis.edu  Scott Aaron  writes  In article  Apr.20.03.02.42.1993.3815 geneva.rutgers.edu   conditt tsd.arlut.utexas.edu  Paul Conditt  wrote        I think its really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere   man  even if he did claim to be the son of God  and or a prophet. Ill pose a question here thats got me thinking   what distinguishes  true  religion from cults  Im speaking generally here  not specifially about Christianity    Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically  he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But  then  Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes  for example  the Branch Davidian  cult  from the Presbyterian  church    Doctrinal differences dont answer the question  IMHO  so dont use them as an answer.As far as I can see  one of the big differences between Davidians andChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myselfin the feet of one of Jesuss disciples.  Basically  they gave up alot     career  possibly family  and well  a whole bunch  to followJesus.So what is the difference   It is quite plain.  Jesus was good andDavid Koresh was not.The problem is  I think  is that we try to legislate what is goodand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance  there are thousands of laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often  it is hardto bring people to justice  because it is not possible to finda legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just then we could tell them to administer justice fairly  and justicewould be followed.  But since judges dont always get it right we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunchesof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect  the justiceof man  into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justicesystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentationmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider a ranting Christian to be bad  but an eloquent person from anotherreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desireto protect the Constitution at all costs  even if it allowspeople to do bad things. I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man ispresenting a false message  even if he is ever ever so mild mannered then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying tosay is that we shouldnt be looking for principles that tell uswhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow andworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.It is simple.  Choose Jesus  and you got it right.  Chooseanyone else  and you got it wrong.  Why   Because Jesus is thebegotten son of God  and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin  andnobody else was.Stephen

It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia  not for individuals  to carry handguns  grenades  and assault rifles.    Read the Constitution yourself.

The above  while literaly true  is a clasic straw man claimin the context of non real time circuits such as E mail and the like.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to  accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure  telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun ications than this lot.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our  private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the  tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of  protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate  the sometimes competing interests of economic growth  privacy and  law enforcement  previous policies have pitted government against  industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.    Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to  protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to  protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptionNormmaly DES.  technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the                                                          unauthorized release of personal information  it also can be used  by terrorists  drug dealers  and other criminals.Note the use of the word  business  in the above. The whole tenor of thisrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only  business  useis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wifesear to remain secret and private  that is not even on the agenda for debate.Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The onlyreference is to information already in the hands of others. The unauthorizedrelease bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people whohave legitimate access abusing it  and revealing  or often selling the info.These people are  of course  in this proposal  the people who will have thekeys.The criminals also use lawers  courts  the CIA  white house officials and pensto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well  Yeah  severalof them would be a better idea than CLipper Them again  the protections of law and the courts have been seriously errodedover the last decade ofr so.  A state of the art microcircuit called the  Clipper Chip  has  been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a                                        NSA  new approach to encryption technology.Yeah  this bit is VERY true. ....It can be used in new   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to  an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications  using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in  commercial use today.  Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demoof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainmentI suspect. Note also the many. not all  as the general tone implies.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary                                           information  protect the privacy of personal phone conversations                                                      and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted  electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the  ability of federal  state and local law enforcement agencies to  intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tighteningof the current abuses. I have not heard  yet  of a case that was impeaded bythe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side  abuse by lawenforcers is well documented  even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other comsis blurred yet again.  A  key escrow  system will be established to ensure that the   Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law abiding  Americans.  A  key escrow  system will be established to ensure that the   Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law abiding  Americans.Lets run that line twice. Not   VERY   carefully what it says. The statedpurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note theword  ensure . As to protect  or law abiding  I will leave to you.So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions the answer in this press release is  YES.  ...Each device containing the chip will have two unique   keys   numbers that will be needed by authorized government  agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the  device is manufactured  the two keys will be deposited separately  in two  key escrow  data bases that will be established by the  Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to  government officials with legal authorization to conduct a  wiretap.Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.   The  Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with no  new authorities to access the content of the private  conversations of Americans.Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology  the  Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new  devices.  In addition  respected experts from outside the  government will be offered access to the confidential details of  the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report  their findings.Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract     And as a later posting asks  what of the STU IIIs they already have. It willbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.After all  it is secure  isnt it. The govt will answer that point by its ownactions.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of  encryptions dual edge sword   encryption helps to protect the  privacy of individuals and industry  but it also can shield  criminals and terrorists.  We need the  Clipper Chip  and other  approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access  to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it  to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology  trends and explore new approaches  like the key escrow system    the President has directed government agencies to develop a  comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates               the privacy of our citizens  including the need to            employ voice or data encryption for business purposes                                                         Again  personal use seems to be a unaskable question.              the ability of authorized officials to access telephone            calls and data  under proper court or other legal                                                                   order  when necessary to protect our citizens Ah  so warrents are not always needed it seems.              the effective and timely use of the most modern            technology to build the National Information            Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and            the competitiveness of American industry in the global            marketplace  and               the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export            high technology products.The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with  affected industries  the Congress and groups that advocate the  privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.  The Administration is committed to working with the private  sector to spur the development of a National Information  Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer  technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to  information.  This infrastructure of high speed networks    information superhighways   will transmit video  images  HDTV  programming  and huge data files as easily as todays telephone  system transmits voice.Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the proper peoplewill be able to express an opinion  hence only the desired result will emerge.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important  role in that infrastructure  the Federal Government must act  quickly to develop consistent  comprehensive policies regarding  its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that  protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting  them from those who break the law.Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly inequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphershas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter  AT THE MOMENT. I have nodoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practicalpurposes by the middle of the next century.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.   The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the new  encryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONS  TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE          Q    Does this approach expand the authority of government       agencies to listen in on phone conversations     A    No.   Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with       no new authorities to access the content of the private       conversations of Americans.    Q    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on       a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation       encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to       decipher the message     A    They would have to obtain legal authorization  normally a       court order  to do the wiretap in the first place.  They       would then present documentation of this authorization to       the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and       obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug       smugglers.  The key is split into two parts  which are       stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key       escrow system.    Q    Who will run the key escrow data banks     A    The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent       entities.  At this point  the Department of Justice and the       Administration have yet to determine which agencies will       oversee the key escrow data banks.It is a little hard to critisise a non proposal.  Q    How strong is the security in the device   How can I be sure       how strong the security is       A    This system is more secure than many other voice encryption       systems readily available today.Note we drop back to phone mode again. If this is a true answer  it can berephrased as   It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work benchwill use it for light amusement before breakfast.   ...   While the algorithm will       remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow       system This link between the security of the key eschrow  and the actual algorithm is a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers  could someone pleaseexplain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them   ...  we are willing to invite an independent panel of       cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all       potential users that there are no unrecognized       vulnerabilities.Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully  OK.    Q    Whose decision was it to propose this product     A    The National Security Council  the Justice Department  the       Commerce Department  and other key agencies were involved in       this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the       President  the Vice President  and appropriate Cabinet       officials.Quick  with out looking back  What name is missing from that list   Q    Who was consulted   The Congress   Industry     A    We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on       encryption issues  and expect those discussions to intensify       as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have       briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the       decisions related to this initiative.The people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.  Q    Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers     A    The government designed and developed the key access       encryption microcircuits  but it is not providing the       microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product       manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip       manufacturer that produces them.The reverse engineering provisions of the Mask work act could be releventhere.  Q    Who provides the  Clipper Chip      A    Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance        California  and will sell the chip to encryption device       manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed       to other vendors in the future.    Q    How do I buy one of these encryption devices      A    We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating       the  Clipper Chip  into their devices.You dont. Not unless you are one of the right people.  Q    If the Administration were unable to find a technological       solution like the one proposed  would the Administration be       willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more       powerful encryption devices     A    This is a fundamental policy question which will be       considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrowThey missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.       mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product       that is more secure  more convenient  and less expensive       than others readily available today  but it is just one       piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to       encryption technology  which the Administration is       developing.I would say  less secure  less conveniant  more expensive   PGP is free   less available  and more prone to being comprimised Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.       The Administration is not saying   since encryption       threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement        we will prohibit it outright   as some countries have       effectively done   nor is the U.S. saying that  every       American  as a matter of right  is entitled to an       unbreakable commercial encryption product. They dont seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposalDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And  this is the one explicitreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes  I dont think that theMexicans  Brazilians  and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamousgesture.  ...  There is a       false  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is       an  either or  proposition.  Rather  both concerns can be        and in fact are  harmoniously balanced through a reasoned        balanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper       Chip  and similar encryption techniques.The false tension is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. TheRIGHT to privacy is hand waved to non existance by putting it behind the  falseassessment . It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever stepsYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable  hence is definedin the govenment language to be non existant. If you dont agree  you must be acriminal  as only criminals dont agree with out laws. Also note the non question.  If what is here was not possible...   Q    What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton       Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from       that of the Bush Administration       A    It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption       technology in telecommunications and computing and are       committed to working with industry and public interest       groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans       privacy  help businesses to compete  and ensure that law       enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime       and terrorism.It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty   insertsuitable retoric   and will stamp out this disorderly  unruley outbreak offreedom and ultra national sentiment.  Q    Will the devices be exportable   Will other devices that use       the government hardware     A    Voice encryption devices are subject to export control       requirements.  Case by case review for each export is       required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The       same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the       attractions of this technology is the protection it can give       to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this       in mind  we expect export licenses will be granted on a       case by case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these       devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan       to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability       of these products.  This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France  they will have to reveal thekeys  and the algorithm. Dont think its at the top of my list of things I musthave  so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a billof crock.Any for any others using it  they must be nuts Good luck folks.

Countersteering  to know or not to know   what is the question ,Organization  University of East AngliaDistribution  netLines  22lotto husc4.harvard.edu  Jerry Lotto  writes  There has been a running thread on the need to understand countersteering.  I have seen a lot of opinion  but not much of it has any basis in fact or study.  The bottom line is  The understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among the accident involved riders in the Hurt study. The  average rider  does not identify that countersteering alone provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves  even after many years of practice.I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. But did the Hurtstudy make any distinction between an  ability  to swerve and a  failure to swerve  In most of the accidents and near accidents that Ive seen  riderswill almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare  simply becausethe instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over rideseverything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusivemanouvres   did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable

This strongly implies that the sheriffs department wanted the property    any drugs  which were not found  were only an excuse.The Ventura County DA came to the same conclusion in the report hereleased  which lambasted the Sheriffs Office.Too bad the old man was nearly blind  and didnt take a fewgoose stepping Drug Warriors  TM  with him.

Ad said Nissan Altima best seller ,Organization  Sun MicrosystemsLines  9Distribution  worldReply To  dbernard clesun.Central.Sun.COMNNTP Posting Host  clesun.central.sun.com I too was puzzled by this obvious untruth. What I think is going on is that Nissan claims that the Altima is  the best selling new car namelplate in the US   I think I have this near verbatim . Lee Iaccocas statistics dept. would have been proud of that sentence.Note that the Corolla Prism are also new designs... but hey are not new  nameplates.   I guess Nissan doesnt even sell as many Altimas asToyota does Corollas  or there would be no  nameplate  qualifier.

I was never able to understand that people actually held such bigoted and backwards views until I came here.I have never been to Wisconsin  though I have been toneighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic  NY  NJ  PA I found that there were few states in the provences that stoodout in this youngsters mind  California  Texas  and Florida to name the most obvious three.  However  both Minnesota and Wisconsinstuck out  solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support thatstates reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably thesame.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota leftwith me about their neighbors.The only question in my head about Wisconsin  though  is whether or not there is a cause effect relationship betweencheese and serial killers    jim halat

But at the present   most people dont seem to think this way.  This  from the same fellow who speaks of an  objective  or  natural  morality.

Israels Expansion II,"Organization  Division of Applied Sciences  Harvard UniversityLines  35Organization  Aiken Computation Lab  Harvard UniversityKeywords  In article  93111.225707PP3903A auvm.american.edu  Paul H. Pimentel  PP3903A auvm.american.edu  writes  What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum   It is the home of the muslim a s well as jewish religion  among others.	Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  Theyinclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli  thefact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people  and thehistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948 the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visitreligious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  TheJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned aJewish cemetary into a hotel  and used the gravestones in theirlatrines.	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions intoJerusalem  protected holy sites  and demonstrated its fitness tocontrol the city.	Also  I should point out that Islam is not centered inJerusalem  but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca where all Muslims should make a pilgramage  the hajj .  Unlike IsraeliJerusalem  Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.AdamAdam Shostack 				       adam das.harvard.edu If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors  we surewouldnt waste them on members of Congress...

I was raised in the South  and part of my cultural heritage is waving at passersby.  I waved from the side of the road at passing cars  when I drove I waved or nodded or at least raised an index finger from the steering wheel.  People waved at me as I drove by. I was raised in the South  and I can attest that this is true.  Why  onone particularly hot day  as I was walking along the road  some goodole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer   Of course  they were going50 mph at the time... P.S. To prove this wasnt a fluke  it happened to me again when I was out riding on Wednesday  an unsolicited wave. Wow...Bikers wave to bikers the world over.

 NEWS Re List or image processing systems ,Distribution  eunetReply To  Club spektr.msk.suOrganization  Moscow Scientific Industrial Ass. SpectrumLines  137       Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association  Spectrum  offer       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC AT wich include software and set of       controllers.                     SOFTWARE            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.            Kit works in the interactive regime  and has include Help for       non professional users.            There are next possibility          input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family          read   white image to   from disk          print image on the printer          makes arithmetic with 2 frames          filter image          work with gistogramme          edit image.         include users exe modules.                     CONTROLLER VS9       The function of VS 9 controller is to load TV images into  PC AT.       VS 9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV frame from       a field of 724x600 pixels.       The clock rate is 14 7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in       the line and 7 4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal       and vertical directions.       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.       Video signal capture time   2.5s.                     CONTROLLER VS52       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was       created on the base of modern elements  including user       programmable gate arrays.       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any       other analog signal  including signals from slow speed scanning       devices .       The controller has the following technical characteristics          memory volume   from 256 K to 2 Mb           resolution when working with standard video signal   from 64x64       to 1024x512 pixels           resolution when working in slow input regime   up to 2048x1024       pixels          video signal capture time   40 ms.         maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb   2048x1024       pixels           number of gray level   256           clock rate for input   up to 30 MHz           4 input video multiplexer           input output lookup table  LUT           possibility to realize  scroll  and  zoom           8 lines for external synchronization  an input using external       controlling signal            electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog         digital converter          possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the       controller by reprogramming it.              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with       512 512 8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation       with two images.            Processor was created on the base of modern elements       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board       for PC.            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512 512 8       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.            The processor has the following technical characteristics          memory volume to 64 Mb          number of the gray level   256          4 input video multiplexer          input output lookup table          electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference          image size from 256 256 to 8192 8192          possibility color and black   white output          possibility input from slow scan video sources.

I can not find the error  and I do not     know how to correct it.    2  Is this the right newsgroup   Where should I go     E mail prefered...                                                        I know you said E mail preferred but because this is a common problemwith WPWin Ill post it here.The screen only LOOKS like the text is gone. Usually you can justpage up then page down and when it does a complete refresh thetext reappears. I have had  on  rare  occasions  to completely exit  save first  the program. When I reopened the file  all chaoshad been resolved. I dont know WHY it does this  but it is annoying.The graphics problems have now made me a Word for Windows user

Giving  spiritual gifts ,Reply To  dxf12 po.cwru.edu  Douglas Fowler Organization  Case Western Reserve University  Cleveland  OH  USA Lines  20     I just thought Id share a nice experience before my exam today.I was walking down the streets on our campus  and a beggar came up and askedme for any spare change I might have.  I had a dollar or so that I gave her and   not wanting to give away all my money to strangers  I generally givea dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something    I offeredher some  spiritual gifts   as I called them  rather than gifts of money.I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day  and hownice it was to give to people   she then said she was getting married soon.She talked about how she and her husband had very little  they may not haveeven had a house  for all I know   but that they felt a very special love inthe Lord  an unselfish kind of caring.  It warmed my heart to know that 2people can have so little monetarily  and realize that spiritually they areindeed very rich.  A good lesson for all of us who say we want more  more more  what we really need cannot be counted  or sold  or bought.

Precisely.Theres no objective medicine  some people get marvellous results fromalternative therapy  others only respond to traditional medicine.Theres no objective physics  Einstein and Bohr have told us that.Theres no objective reality.  LSD should be sufficient to prove that.  One wonders just what people who ask such questions understand by the term    objective   if anything.I consider it to be a useful fiction  an abstract ideal we can strivetowards.  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string  it doesntactually exist  but we can talk about things as if they were like it  and notbe too far wrong.mathew

The arrogance of Christians,"Lines  37vbv r2d2.eeap.cwru.edu  Virgilio  Dean  B. Velasco Jr.  writes   	I just thought Id share some words that I received in a letter   from Moody Bible Institute a couple of months ago.  The words are by  James M. Stowell  the president of MBI.    	 The other day  I was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing.  It caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing evangelical  Christians  saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones  who know what the absolutes are.    	 He missed the point.No  IMO  Mr. Stowell missed the point.  	 We affirm the absolutes of Scripture  not because we are arrogant  moralists  but because we believe in God who is truth  who has revealed His  truth in His Word  and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance  of those absolutes. Mr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.I dont see how that necessarily follows.  Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths  and therefore absolutes  If the answer to either of these questions is no  then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths  andwhich truths are absolutes.  And  who is qualified to make these determinations   There is hardly consensus  even in evangelical Christianity  not to mention the rest of Christianity  regarding Biblical interpretation.I find Mr. Stowells statement terribly simple minded.Carol Alvincaralv auto trol.com"

Well  yes and no.  I dont particularly want this discussion to sparka lengthy debate  but I do think its worth pointing out that  popularusage  is not always sufficient excuse.  In this case  for example  I think an appropriate parallel may be foundin the pronunciation of proper names  if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name  would you feel compelled to change it   Probablynot.  The same is true of X.   The X Window System    X    X11   and relatedmonickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is aproper name.  In fact  some of them are  trademarked  names.  The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  As for the trade publications that promulgate things like  X Window  or X.windows  or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees  consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by  journalists .  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldntbe bothered to get the name of his her source right   Would you trusta product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong Popular usage is as it may be  but I for one am all for holding peoplewho claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

And what was the reasoning of this genius writer   That  even though their  pitching is at best  sound   they will win on the strength of their offense.  Lesse              93 offense   92 offense    Thompson   Incaviglia                           92 offense   72 wins                       93 division winners    at least  88 wins                So                                88 wins   72 wins    Thompson   Incaviglia     Therefore                  16 wins   Thompson   Incaviglia    What did you learn in school today     If you take a math course and your teacher turns out to be Rob Rains  run   dont walk  to drop add.                                                                   P. Tierney    You obviously dont know what the hell youre talking about.  No   Thompson and Incaviglia dont equal 16 wins  but Ill take the two  of them over Stan Javier and Ruben Amaro  .249 1HR  334AB    .219 7HR 374 AB   Id say this improvement should equate to 6or 7  wins at least.    Then  Ill take Lenny Dykstra who played 85 games last year and  project his numbers  .301  104 hits  18 2Bs  6 HR  39RBI  30 SB   over 150 games. Thus .301  188 hits  32 2Bs  11HR  70RBI  54 SB   Okay  now well put these numbers in the leadoff hole and thus  I have to bump Kruk  Hollins  Daulton RBI numbers up just a tad...  now lesse... they knocked in 70  93  and 109 respectively.  Dont  you think its fair to add about 5 or 6 RBI to each   They managed  to knock in a pretty nice amount of runs with a .219 leadoff hitter.  Okay bozo  do you think its fair to add maybe 7 or 8 more wins  now     Oh  and how can I forget Wes Chamberlain  275 ABs 9 HR    41 RBI even WITH a month and 1 2 in AAA and a horrible first half.  Well project that over a full season to get 18 HR and 80 RBI or so.  Is that worth a win or two       Finally  take the  worse  pitching staff in the NL last year  add  the worse injury decimation of 1992.  Okay  now we add Danny  jackson  some health  and a full season for Schilling... is that  worth at least 3 wins     Okay weve been conservative and added about 18 wins so far.  Now  were adding about 4 more wins thanks to the expansion teams...  Okay  thats 22 wins.  Lesse dipshit math genuious  72   22   94  Hmmm... I think thats good enough to win the worse division in  baseball     Next time  before you say something foolish  get a clue first      Actually  I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so called genius BWwriter.  I agree.  The reasoning was foolish.  Next time  before you say something foolish  be aware what you are respondingto.BTW  94 wins.

the usual,Organization  California Institute of Technology  PasadenaLines  41Distribution  naNNTP Posting Host  sandman.caltech.eduhollombe polymath.tti.com  The Polymath  writes  The possession of nuclear arms  actually weapons grade fissionables  is currently regulated only by market forces.  I.e.   To own them you have to either make them  buy them or steal them.  The only thing that stops you is the staggering cost  more than most nations can afford   the fact that no one who has them wants to sell to you and the tight security maintained on existing stocks.  Just ask Saddam Hussein .I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials  i.e. plutonium or reactor weapons grade uranium  one was required to obtaina federal permit to own such materials. Given a source of fissionables  you can build a bomb in your garage with parts from hardware stores and electronic junk supplies.  You might have to engage in some shady dealings to get the explosive charge  but thats trivial compared to getting the plutonium.  The basic information on the design was declassified years ago and can be dug out of any technical library by a physics grad student.Actually  why bother looking it up   From the material we covered lastterm  in 10 weeks  of Ge Ch 127  Nuclear Chemistry   I could  derive what it would take to build a bomb.  And as far as the explosive charge I  as a chemist  could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonlyavailable chemicals in the garage if I felt like.  The electronics behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier however . . . but not impossible using a few  tricks of the trade. And if I really wanted to be nasty  I could include a core of hydrogen and deuterium . . .Of course  the hardest part is getting the fissionable materialto start with  and living long enough to put a bomb together.

Thats a ridiculous comparison  I know  but the point is that Saturns  and high end Civics  for that matter  accelerate just fine  in fact better than most unimproved  muscle  cars of the 60s  300 hp is great  but tied to 2 tons  it just doesnt go that quick. Saturns  on the other hand  use 125 hp tied to 2400 lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the line. Anyway....   While your 0 60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports  I sawthe PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5 speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  Im sure that mostSL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed  but 7.9 seconds is stillastonishingly fast for a small 4 door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds0 60  if Im not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the9 second range.Mihir Shah

THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                           April 16  1993                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYThe President today announced a new initiative that will bringthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.The initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and securetelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.For too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth  privacy andlaw enforcement  previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information  it also can be usedby terrorists  drug dealers  and other criminals.A state of the art microcircuit called the  Clipper Chip  hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation  protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal  state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A  key escrow  system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2 keys   numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured  the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two  key escrow  data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The  Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology  theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition  respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryptions dual edge sword   encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry  but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the  Clipper Chip  and otherapproaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches  like the key escrow system  the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates           the privacy of our citizens  including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes           the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data  under proper court or other legal          order  when necessary to protect our citizens           the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace  and           the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries  the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high speed networks  information superhighways   will transmit video  images  HDTVprogramming  and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure  the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent  comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONSTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ    Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations A    No.   Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message A    They would have to obtain legal authorization  normally a     court order  to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts  which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q    Who will run the key escrow data banks A    The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point  the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key escrow data banks.Q    How strong is the security in the device   How can I be sure     how strong the security is   A    This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system  we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q    Whose decision was it to propose this product A    The National Security Council  the Justice Department  the     Commerce Department  and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President  the Vice President  and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q    Who was consulted   The Congress   Industry A    We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues  and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q    Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A    The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits  but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q    Who provides the  Clipper Chip  A    Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance      California  and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q    How do I buy one of these encryption devices  A    We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the  Clipper Chip  into their devices.     Q    If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed  would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices A    This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure  more convenient  and less expensive     than others readily available today  but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology  which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying   since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement      we will prohibit it outright   as some countries have     effectively done   nor is the U.S. saying that  every     American  as a matter of right  is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.   There is a     false  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is     an  either or  proposition.  Rather  both concerns can be      and in fact are  harmoniously balanced through a reasoned      balanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper     Chip  and similar encryption techniques.Q    What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration   A    It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans     privacy  help businesses to compete  and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q    Will the devices be exportable   Will other devices that use     the government hardware A    Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case by case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind  we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case by case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.         	Jim Gillogly	Trewesday  25 Astron S.R. 1993  17 01"

Is it good that Jesus died ,Organization  Starfleet Headquarters  San FranciscoLines  111brian lpl.arizona.edu  Brian Ceccarelli 602 621 9615  writes   They do not want to know it or be exposed to light  because their own evil deeds will be uncovered.  And so by their own choice  they will remain in darkness.  Sort of like bugs under a rock.  However  some people  but not many  will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.  These people will crawl out from under the rock  and although blinded at first  will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warm.  And after a while  by virtue of the light  they will see the depths of their own shortcomings AND how to correct them.  And also  they will see that there is much much more to this world than just the narrow little experiences under the rock.  They will  discover that life under a rock was incredibly yukky and that life with the Light of the World  is great.  So great  that they will want to tell all their friends about it.And I maintain Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge thatthey alone are their own masters  because they fear it  they are tooafraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so  bytheir own choice  they will remain in darkness  sort of like bugsunder a rock.  However  some people  but not many  will not like thedarkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.These people will crawl out from under the rock  and  although blindedat first  will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.

We all have an adversion to it to some extent.  But Brian Kendig who has been replying to this thread certainly likes darkness.  Brian K. enjoys stating false concepts and false pressumptions about the God of the Bible.  Without checking his own presumptions  he compares my God with Odin or Zeus.Look  you just practically equated Odin and Zeus   Theyre as muchdifferent as your god is from them...Dont you see   Im not going to accept ANYTHING that I cant witnesswith my own eyes or experience with my own senses  especially notsomething as mega powerful as what youre trying to get me to accept.Surely if you believe in it this strongly  you must have a good reason  to  dont you  Withough checking his own presumption  he thinks hell is the equivalent of non existence.When did I say that   I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING insteadof being subject to the whims of a deity  but that if the deitydecided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am  then so be it. Do you enjoy darkness   Most people will honestly admit  yes .  Most people are fond of their sexual sins  their hording of money  their selfishness  and not to mention  their Biblical ignorance.Nope    most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feelingthat they are imperfect  of believing that the world is an undesirableplace  of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice andholy again  of doing just as their priests tell them  like good littlesheep.  You enjoy darkness  and youre proud of it.You may know the Bible well    but have you read any of the Koran   OrZen writings   Or Hare Krishna literature   If you havent  then howcan you say you have an open mind  Sin is fun   Lets admit it.  But a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this life  and hell in the next.Nope.  You make decisions  enjoy your successes  and accept yourfailures  then you die.  If you are content with the life youve ledas you reflect back on it in your final moments  then youve led agood life. Come out from under the rock.  Please do.      For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son      that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal     life. Im sorry  I dont feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any godId worship would do  unless the sacrifice was only temporary  inwhich case its not really all that important.Forget the Bible for a minute.

AFS  AFS      Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts Jews killed Germans in WWII    Germans killed Jews in WWII  BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements  regardless of what Nazi revisionists say  SY  My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in SY  todays Georgia. There were villages  Kurd Turk  different Turkic groups  SY  Georgian  muslim christian  Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. SY  The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  SY  different people. For example  my grandfather would not have been happy  SY  if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy.

Maybe  SY  first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people  SY  to hate Turks Kurds  It seems so...There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of theArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915  with that of the Armeno Georgian conflicts of late 1918  The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence  but rather the wholesale destruction ofAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak  Lori  and Pambak afterthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region  cannot be equated with theextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians diedin this area in the scramble to re occupy these lands and the lack ofpreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier  hundreds of kilometersaway  SY  Anyway  but after they killed raped ... Turks and other muslim people SY  around  people assumed that Armenians killed us  raped our women  SY  not a particular group of people trained in some camps  maybe backed SY  by some powerful states... After that step  you cannot explain these  SY  people not to hate all Armenians. I dont follow  perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light. SY  So what am I trying to point out  First  at least for that region  SY  you cannot blame Turks Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. SY  Most of the Armenians  I think  are not to blame either. But since some SY  people started that fire  it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. SY  People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish SY  a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with SY  different ethnic cultural religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately SY  very easy to start a fire Again  the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918 19 had little todo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting thatthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation  Armenia  Azerbaijan  and Georgia  made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku  in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians militarily. Of course  as Turkish troops marched across what was left ofCaucasian Armenia  many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern Anatolia. My fathers mothers family escaped Cemiskezek    Erzinka    Erzerum    Nakhitchevan    Tiflis    Constantinople    Massachusetts.  SY  My grandparents were  not  bloodthirsty people.

The Turks would kill any Armenianyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive today. SY  You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. SY  They experienced their own pain  of course. That is the way it is.

Honestly. The word of Sin is Restriction.  Would I kid you  Does one mans words encompass the majestic vision of thousandsof individuals   Quoting a man is not the same as quoting theOrder.  Taken out of context  words can be interpreted muchdifferently than had one applied them within the confines oftheir original expression.I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta  Frater Superior of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bitfrom Merlinus X he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremesto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.I have little knowledge regarding Reuss background  but surelyhe was an unusual man  and he was an important force in the Order for many years.Yet as people change so do Orders change  and while we look backso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this isonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassedwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that therewas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Orderitself  perhaps by testing the limits myself.Let us examine this issue a bit more closely.... In 1895  Karl Kellner  1850 1905   a wealthy Austrian industrialistand paper chemist  as well as a high grade Mason  founded the OrdoTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East  where hemet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  Kellners efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by FranzHartmann  Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss  who had worked togetherprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902in Reusss Masonic publication  Oriflamme.  On Kellners death Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head  O.H.O. .  The Jubilee edition ofthe Oriflamme  published in 1912  announced that the Order taughtsecret of sexual magic.  Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28  1855 inAugsburg  he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer  journalist andpossibly a spy for the Prussian political police  infiltrating the SocialistLeague founded by Karl Marxs daughter and her husband.  Reuss waslater associated with William Wynn Westcott  a leader of the GoldenDawn  who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss tofound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After severalattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites  Reuss settled on thedevelopment of the O.T.O. The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss leadership.For example  he chartered Papus in France  Rudolph Steiner in Berlinand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912  the historic meeting betweenReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him andaccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him forthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of allthe English speaking world  and it was this authorization that he invokedwhen publishing the material of the Equinox. Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering astroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a breakin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.over the book  which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reusss request  deeplyinfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation. _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._  by Ad Veritatem IXWithin _Equinox III 10_  Edited by   Hymenaeus Beta  Frater Superior  Rex Summus Sanctissimus     Caliph of the United States of America       Published by Samuel Weiser  1990.There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included thismaterial in _Equinox III 10_.  And this is the real point  is it not Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his ownorganization   Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principleof Thelema   Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth verycomplex pictures with no easy answers   A picture which leaves roomfor very many interpretations.It is quite easy for me to see  for example  that all of O.T.O. derivedout of the dribble of faltering Masonry  purchased by clever hucksterswith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And Ican take that all the way down to our present Caliph  whose feeblesupport of the Law of Thelema is laughable at best.Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way   Will I   I think not.Why   Because my Frater will see it as a perspective  an interjectionI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express thingsin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may bequite difficult to apprehend at first.So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.I do not support Reusss words myself  as I am not qualified to assessthem  and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member ofthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so  thenwhat can this say about the health of the Order   Does it mean thatthe Order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles   Ordoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will ofuniversal kinship arise on its own  not shackled by some dogmaticrequirement   How shall we resolve these two possibilities I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcaneor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area  many who are orwere very heavily involved with the Order   I can vouch for the integrityof the organization as it stands.I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments I followed my intuition  and Ive found little to stop me from requestinga Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  Im happily participatingin social groups  Feasts or Initiations  and have come to know the GnosticMass well enough for my tastes. This doesnt make me an authority on Order politics and explanations  however.I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on mylimited contact with other members.I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are manyways to interpret words  and many people who have become involved withthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedomand the preservation of individual vision.I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in responseto other posts in this thread.Invoke me under my stars.

SSPX schism  ,"Organization  noneLines  138In article  Apr.20.03.03.06.1993.3836 geneva.rutgers.edu  shellgate llo uu4.psi.com  Larry L. Overacker  writes    You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  Im not trying to be   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction   and authority  what authority do you rely upon for your decisions    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time    This is especially true  since Councils of Bishops have basically   stood by the Pope.The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  Thisis the  only  thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for  hisdeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commandsfrom  any  authority conflict with Tradition  the commands must bedisobeyed.My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a majorway.  God would never allow a hair splitting situation to develop  itwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I dont view thepresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in theCatholic Church  and any impartial observer will be aghast.   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition  and also over   authority and discipline.  The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the CatholicFaith  in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about theCatholic Faith  this leaves them wide open for destruction by erringbishops.  Its basically the Reformation part II.There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects theshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by theCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for anhour  probably.Take the situation in Campos  Brazil  for example.  Im reading a bookon what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop  Antoniode Castro Mayer  never introduced all the changes that followed in thewake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass  the same oldcatechisms  etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith  theCatholic theology of obedience  what Modernism was  etc.  Heinnoculated the people against what was coming.Well  one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It camewhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro Mayer waited until the Poperecovered  then inquired whether this command was what the Pope reallywanted  or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishopwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro Mayersclergy from their churches  because they refused to celebrate the NewMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish  and celebrate a New Mass.The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishopwas  enraged  by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help ofthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  Thepriests would just start building new churches  the people werecompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass  as thebishop desired    and virtually no parishioners.The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal  according tocanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying thetraditional Mass  because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.During all this process  the people of Campos  not just privateindividuals  but including civil authorities  were constantly sendingpetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernistbishop.  NOTHING was ever done  no help ever arrived from Rome.Eventually 37 priests were kicked out  and about 40 000 people.   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this 	 Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms	 could change and be conformed to those of the Pope   assuming that	 the Popes position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX	 dont jointly make such  choice.    If not  this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.   If I adopt the view that  Im NOT wrong  I CANT be wrong  and   theres NO WAY Ill change my mind  YOU must change yours   that   Ive either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra  that would be the endof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood inCatholic theology  and anyone who doesnt go along with it is aninstant non Catholic.The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on inthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith  and what our bishops aredoing  they would be shocked    We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the  real    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.This isnt the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive bodyof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years areespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditionaldoctrine is.   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.    I may be wrong here  Im not Roman Catholic.    Thats heresy  more or less.  Although they have done a great jobsince the Reformation  the last 30 years have seen so many errorsspread that its pitiful.Infallibility rests in the Pope  and in the Church as a whole.  In theshort term  a Pope  or large sections of the Church can go astray.  Infact  thats what usually happens during a major heresy  largesections of the Church go astray.   The Pope historically has beenmuch more reliable.   Everything will always come back in the longrun.   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement   regarding the SSPX situation   Would it be honored   If not  how   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility    Again  Im not trying to be contentions  Im trying to understand.   Since Im Orthodox  Ive got no real vested interest in the outcome    one way or the other.Yes  it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But whatis he going to define   That the New Mass is a better expression ofthe Catholic Faith than the old   That sex education in the Catholicschools is wonderful   That all religions are wonderful except forthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II    It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the   Popes commands as legitimate.  Why   This is a VERY slippery slope.Not really  start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels atcritical thought  remember   Thats what Catholic theologians havebeen busy at for centuries."

After 2000 years  can we say that Christian Morality is,Organization  Netcom. San Jose  CaliforniaLines  91frank D012S658.uucp  Frank ODwyer  writes ...  ray netcom.com  Ray Fischer  writes   frank D012S658.uucp  Frank ODwyer  writes ...   Plus questions for you   why do subjectivists relativists nihilists get so    het up about the idea that relativism is  better  than objectivism      To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the  truth than is objectivism  it provides more power and ability to  control events.  I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are relative.   Accuracy is a value judgement  too.  It so happens I agree with  the substance of what you say below  but its clear to me that at least   some  values are objective.  Truth is better than falsehood  peace is better than war  education is better than ignorance.  We know these things  if we know anything.While Ill agree that these are generally held to be  good things   Iquestion whether they come very close to being objective values.Especially considering that at one time or another each has beenviewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up withanything that could be said to be universally  good  or  bad .And when I referred to  the truth  I was using the termhypothetically  realizing full well that there may not even be such athing.  Assuming  for the moment  that morals _are_ relative  then two  relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute  truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that  produces the desired results.  No they cannot  because they acknowledge up front that THE desired results do not exist.  That  after all  is the meaning of compromise.  Plus some problems  If the relativists have no values in common  compromise  is impossible   what happens then     Who  if anyone  is right   What happens  if one relativist has a value  Never compromise  .  A value  plant bombs in  crowded shopping areas    After all  if morals are relative  these values  cannot  meaningfully  be said to be incorrect.True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more thanpersonal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is anysense of _personal_ accountability   the justification for anysocially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some  higher authority  aka  absolute moral truth .  Assuming that there is an absolute morality  two disagreeing   objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right  there  is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals   you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees  with you is amoral.  Untrue.  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth.  Part of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility is better than rigidity  compromise is better than believing you have a lock on morals  etc.  In the same way  I can believe in an objective reality without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse  or who shot JFK.An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth Interesting notion.      Certainly one can have as ones morals a belief that compromise isgood.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something mostpeople do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise asbeing an absolute moral  but then what happens when someone elseinsists on no compromise   How do you compromise on compromising   Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention   Id say that compromise seems to be  better .  And I would agree.   But its bloody to pointless to speak of it if its merely a matter of taste.  Is your liking for peace any better founded than someone elses liking for ice cream   Im looking for a way to say  yes  to that question  and relativism isnt it.Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thingover another  be it morals or consequences  people only consider thoseaspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying acommitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long  healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true  it isincomplete in ignoring the benefits of war   killing off the mostagressive member of society  trimming down the population  stimulatingproduction.  The equation is always more complex than presented.To characterize relative morals as merely following ones ownconscience   desires is to unduly simplify it.

Ville Sirens slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1 1  and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin  1 2 after the first period. The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo made it 1 3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then  during the Finnish pressure  Sweden turned the game around in 1 47. Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal  and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front  who backhanded the puck low  2 3. Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund  and the Finnish defense let Ahlund  skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal  3 3. Next  Roger Hansson  behind the goal  sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didnt see the puck since there was traffic in front  4 3. Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan  the Shadow  Nilsson. Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone  Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake  5 3. Then  Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds  First he scored the 5 4 goal  and after that he came in alone  with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot  showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot. The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6 5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side  Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterers goals far side. But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the games final goal to make it 6 6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that  maybe  Aslin should have saved. All in all  a decent game where the defense wasnt the best. Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations. Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson  Nilsson Juhlin best line overall again  it seems to be a working WC line. Stillman good on defense. Some players arent good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund  faell ner hjaelmen och jobba    Roger Hansson  Challe Berglund  Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros. Two goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didnt have a very good game  weve seen him a lot better  so Lindfors is probably Finlands starting goalie in the WC. I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.

That there are twoconflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about a .

The unit for current is the AMPERE which is the name of a french mannamed AMPERE who studied electrical current.  The term AMP is just an abbreviationof it.  The company AMP came after the AMPERE unit was already in use.

Clipper Chip and crypto key escrow ,"Summary  Whatever...Keywords  Hmm...Organization   George Mason University  Fairfax Va.Distribution  world Expires  06 31 93 Lines  65	After reading the debate over the Clipper  I have a few things toadd.	First  most of the people I know who activly use encryptionprivately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All theycare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That after all IS the bottom line. 	Second  if I look at all the people I know who use any formof encryption at all  and this group spans people from the morons whostill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard  to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies  I can not thinkof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leavestheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this  because people makemistakes by nature  and the US government is made up of people who arejust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 	Third  since most of the people I know are at least marginalyfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryptionstratigies  I cant see how most of them are going to blindly trust thatsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So  I can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.	Fourth  when it comes to criminal abuse  sure there are many stupidpeople out there. And yes  some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However  anyone who is going todo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is goingto run into that problem pretty damned fast and  I would assume  startlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 	If nothing else were avalible  none of this would be an issue. However the truth is that most private encryption users that Ive ever run intosimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anythingelse. If it works  they use it. This is not going to change either. I donot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will beslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is  if anything the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.	The bottom line here is that people will use what works  andunavoidibly  Im sure most criminals would rather face an encryptionrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penaltycharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat isout of the bag  Or if you have an interest in snooping  Pandoras Boxhas been opened   and this is not going to change. Ive seen a blindnessto this that Ive found utterly stunning  and the Clipper Chip  alongwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a largerdegree.

A visit from the Jehovahs Witnesses,Organization  Technical University Braunschweig  GermanyLines  114In article  1993Apr5.091139.823 batman.bmd.trw.com jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com writes     Didnt you say Lucifer was created with a perfect nature   Yes.  Define perfect then.     I think you   are playing the usual game here  make sweeping statements like omni     holy  or perfect  and dont note that they mean exactly what they say.   And that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to   contradictions.  Im not trying to play games here.  But I understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as atheism.  Take your foot out of your mouth  I wondered about that already when Iwas a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvableis one of the reasons why I am an atheist. Believe me  I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that showsthe power of religion and not anything about its claims.     Now God could have prevented Lucifers fall by taking away his ability   to choose between moral alternatives  worship God or worship himself     but that would mean that God was in error to have make Lucifer or any   being with free will in the first place.     Exactly. God allows evil  an evil if there ever was one.    Now thats an opinion  or at best a premise.  But from my point of view  it is not a premise which is necessary true  specifically  that it is an evil to allow evil to occur.  It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evilhappen or allowing evil to take place  in this place even causing evil is another evil.     But could you give a definition of free will  Especially in the   presence of an omniscient being     Will  is  self determination .  In other words  God created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of God.  All  will   therefore  is  free will .  The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do evenbefore the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known the course of events is fixed. Not even for the omniscient itself  to extend an argument by James Tims.     If God is omniscient  then   clearly  creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than   the emergence of ungodliness  evil sin  since He created them knowing   the outcome in advance.     Why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it   will happen  Why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of   doing good or not doing good  but that does not necessarily imply   doing evil. It is logically possible  but your god has not done it.  I do not know that such is logically possible.  If God restrains a free beings choice to choose to do evil and simply do  not good   then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice  And if  good  is defined as loving and obeying God  and avoiding those behaviors which God prohibits  then how can you say that one who is  not good  is not evil as well   Like I said  I am not sure that doing  not good  without doing evil is logically possible. And when I am not omnipotent  how can I have free will  You have saidsomething about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we havewhat you define as free will. Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings  but I cannot harm them.Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of gooddeeds  but dont make them long for them  so they can not feel the absenceof good as evil. But whose case am I arguing  It is conceivable  so the omnipotent can do it.Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well  youhave to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.  Deletion   Perhaps it is weak  in a way.  If I were just speculating about the ubiquitous pink unicorns  then there would be no basis for such speculation.  But this idea of God didnt just fall on me out of the blue     or while reading science fiction or fantasy.   I know that some will disagree       The Bible describes a God who is omniscient  and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice  from which the definitional logic follows.  But thats not all there is to it. There seems to be  at least in my mind  a certain amount of evidence which indicates that God exists and that the Biblical description of Him may be a fair one.  It is that evidence which bolsters the argument in my view. That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroysthe credibility of the bible  nothing less. And a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god unfortunately  there cant be any with these definitions.   Benedikt
Certainty and Arrogance,Lines  112My last article included this quote   If any substantial number of    talk.religion.misc    readers read some  Wittgenstein  60  of the postings would disappear.   If they  understood   some Wittgenstein  98  would disappear.          Michael L SiemonSomeone called  boundary wrote    This quote seems a little arrogant  dont you think There is a convention called a  smiley  which looks like this         .It is supposed to look like a sideways smiley face  and indicates that thepreceding comment is supposed to be funny.And  Ill note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for overfive years    Id say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8    In the meat of his reply  Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of whatI meant by  There is no way out of the loop .  I wrote that human brains  areinfested with sin   and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.In reply  Mr Boundary wrote   I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly formed conscience  can be trusted virtually ALL the time.Which just moves the problem back one level  how do you tell if yourconscience is properly formed The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging theformed ness of your own conscience.  In other words  you can only be surethat your conscience is  properly formed if you assume that your evaluationcan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time  Illgrant  but its not a valid way of reasoning.Unless you are infallible  your judgements about your own thinking cannot becertain.  Therefore  it is not possible to be certain your conscience is properly formed.   Whatever that is supposed to mean. Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem   Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the  infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church             Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.The Church is  by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation How do you know   Presumably  you believe this because of some argument oranother    how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes You write   Therefore  although our minds are finite and susceptible to error  our  competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our  ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true  even in areas  not subject to the experimental method. But there is a huge difference between  confidence in our ability todistinguish what is true from what is not true and  infallible.  I amconfident about a lot of things  but absolute certainty is a very long wayfrom  confident.This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain really  go check the subject line .  Saying you are absolutely certain issignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say thatyou are confident  that invites people to ask why.Except in very limited circumstances  when you say that you are absolutelycertain  it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have anyidea of his own fallibility.I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably infallible source oftruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All ofthem    every last one    has claimed that he was himself infallible.The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.Darren F Provine   kilroy gboro.rowan.edu This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to theoriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original posterregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wronganswers in religion  and that the difference can have eternalconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he isat least in significant danger of ending up there  I will admit that   as you say    the reasoning processes I used to reach this arefallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But thesebasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think itsunlikely that Im misinterpreting it.   In order to get this level ofconfidence  Ive tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully asto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I havent  forexample said that all non Christians will definitely end up in hell and I havent attempted to describe hell in any detail.   I have afeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant andintolerant even though I acknowledge that Im fallible and so theressome chance Im wrong.Dont get me wrong    I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogantChristians  and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at leastsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences forcertain decisions  its not my fault    Im just telling it the way Ithink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up thatway.  Its one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it mostdifficult to respond to.  But its not arrogance for me to tell whatI think is the truth.  clh 
What if the USSR had reached the Moon first ,Nntp Posting Host  extro.ucc.su.oz.auOrganization  Sydney University Computing Service  Sydney  NSW  AustraliaLines  25jgreen trumpet.calpoly.edu  James Thomas Green  writes  If they had beaten us  I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings  but we also would have been more determined to set up a base  both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon .  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars  at least in the short run .  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon.Great speculation   I remember being proud on behalf of all the freeworld  you think that way when you are seven years old  that we hadgot there first. Now Im almost sorry that it worked out that way.I guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too  andwould almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency thatovertook the US program. Perhaps stretching to match US efforts wouldhave destabilized them sooner than it did in fact   and in the traditionof Marvel Comics What If  this destabilization in the Brezhnev era mighthave triggered the third world war.

Young Catchers,Article I.D.  blue.7975Organization  Department of Industrial EngineeringLines  115mss netcom.com  Mark Singer  said   We know that very  very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs  especially when they havent even played AAA ball.  Yes.  But this is  irrelevant .  Youre talking about averages  when wehave lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base ourdecisions on.I might as well say  We know that very  very few people are more than 7 feettall  so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.  No.  Maybe I need to improve my writing skills.  Lopez  who is very ordinary defensively  is not likely to hit so well at age 22  having not played at AAA level  that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the Braves lineup in 1993.Why isnt Lopez likely to hit that well   He hit that well last year  afteradjusting his stats for park and league and such   he hit better  on anabsolute scale  than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between theminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment  and I dontbelieve there is   then wouldnt you rather waste Lopezs 22 year old goodseason than his 23 year old very good season or his 24 year old excellentseason   The sooner you get him acclimated  the more of his prime you get touse.  Lopez was hitting .588 over 17 AB when he was cut from spring  training.  What does he have to do to earn a chance   Maybe not a full  time job  but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove  his worth   Gee.  I dont know.  17 abs sounds pretty good to me   About as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at AAA.  Talk about  me  as a GM...The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample  but rather that hehadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead managerto question whether his minor league numbers were for real  or to send himdown  until he gets warmed up . OK.  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 Most players are  never  ready for the bigs.  What does this have to dowith Javy Lopez  Most players  benefit  rather than being stagnant or hurt  by playing at AAA.See above.   Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs.  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the Braves for this year.But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Mostplayers arent that good  so they probably wont be that good this yeareither. Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games  to work with the pitchers  to throw out runners.  And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble. Not superstars mind you  but solid  experienced veterans.Not superstars  not stars  not even good players.  Maybe average  if werebeing charitable. The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield  an excellent platoon at first  a solid MVP candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.  Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big yearin his bat  but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is abig question mark.  The Bream Hunter platoon is decent  not excellent  andhas rotten OBP or SLG  depending on whos in .  Blauser is a very valuablebat... for a shortstop. The center field platoon will probably hit .300.  However good Lopez bat  might  be  given the above  it wont be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability.  Wanna bet   The difference between Lopezs bat and Olson Berryhill could be20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a playerwith experience and a player who can play  Ill take the latter every time. The kid  will  improve playing at AAA  Just like Keith Mitchell did  I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.  My  goodness.  Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential That was me  and you so far your only counter proposal is that theyreally dont understand how good Lopez is  or overvalue experience or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was moreflattering to the organization. Are they idiots who have built this ballclub    Well argued but inflammatory reply deleted.      David M.

XCopyPlane Question,"In Reply To  nancie neko.CSS.GOVs message of 19 Apr 1993 19 48 30  0400Organization  Kubota Pacific Computer Inc.Lines  52    In article  BUZZ.93Apr19101538 lion.bear.com  buzz bear.com  Buzz Moschetti  write   In article  WHALEY.93Apr15103931 sigma.kpc.com  whaley sigma.kpc.com  Ken Whaley  writes        Actually  I must also ask the FAQs  1 most popular reason why graphics       dont show up  do you wait for an expose event before drawing your       rectangle       Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains   Xlib graphics.  A button widget  when pressed  will cause a new item   to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea       or equiv  directly  instead  it should register the existence of the new   item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care   of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the   Window is mapped.      The problem  of course  is that no expose event is generated if the window   is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to  tickle  a window so   that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item        What does this have to do with my original question     I previously  stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth 8 pixmap to the screen  just to make sure that my image had data  and it did.  This is NOT  a problem with expose events  it has to do with XCopyPlane not  working       Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that  XCopyPlane works     This would be very helpful     Thanks What it has to do with your original question is this  many times beginning X users  heck  experienced X users too   write small testprograms.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to exposeevents  and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the applicationsgraphics show up  and sometimes they dont.  Were just trying toeliminate all the  easy  explanations  for why youre not seeing yourgraphics. That being said  why dont you try copying different planes to yourwindow other than 16     1    4 .  Try 1  1  1  1  2  ...  1  7to see it you get any output.  Since youre dipslaying only a single plane of your data  its possible that all the pixel values in yourpixmap have the same value for that color plane.

Lets see if we agree     on the terms definition. A homophobe is one who actively and     militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent     homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation.     Since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a     homophobe  your implication is clear   it must necessarily follow that     all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least.         Crap crap crap crap crap.  A definition of any type of phobe comes from  phobia   an irrational fear of.  Hence a homophobe  not only in ACT UP meetings   the word is apparently in general use now.  Or perhaps it isnt in the bible     Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak      Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider   Does an  agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space   Do you  understand English     Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  They will do their best  to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or  run away.  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes   People  who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or  cause them  or themselves  violence.  Isnt that what I said ...What are you taking issue with here  your remarks are merelyparenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.   ...        It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function      other than limiting population growth  since evolution only occurs     when the members of one generation pass along their traits to     subsequent generations. Homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. If I     take your usage of the term  homophobe  in the sense you seem to     intend  then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our     species at least  is going nowhere.         So  every  time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children   Hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.  Obviously you keep to the  Monty Python song    Every sperm is sacred .  And if  as  you  say  it has  a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is  by your own   arguement  natural.Consider the context  Im talking about an evolutionary function. Oneof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of aspecies procreate  those who dont have no purpose in that context.       Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to     survive  the participation of both parents is necessary   a family must     exist  since homosexuals do not reproduce  they cannot constitute a     family. Since the majority of humankind is part of a family      homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation  contrary to nature if you     will.         Well if that is true  by your own arguements homosexuals would have   vanished  years  ago due to non procreation.  Also the parent from single  parent families should put the babies out in the cold now  cos they must   by your arguement  die.By your argument  homosexuality is genetically determined. As to yoursecond point  you prove again that you have no idea what contextmeans. I am talking about evolution  the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process.       But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually      prefer  a heterosexual relationship  homosexuality is a social     abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative     to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in     the most fundamental social element  the family. But wait  theres     more.         Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now  with  the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation  admittedly  without it there would be no one  but more to do with pleasure.  In pre pill  and pre condom days  if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.  These days is just aint true   People can decide whether or not to have   children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose its sex  c  but thats   another arguement...  so its more of a  lifestyle  decision.  Again by  your arguement  since homosexuals can not  or choose not  to reproduce they must  be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are   as  unnatural  as each other.Yet another non sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that existsfor procreation  that it is also recreation is incidental. Thathomosexuals dont procreate means that sex is  only  recreation andnothing more  they serve no  evolutionary  purpose.       Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some     policy makers that they have civil rights  they are now claiming that     their sexuality is a preference  a life style  an orientation  a     choice that should be protected by law. Now if homosexuality is a mere     choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti social  then it     is a perverse choice  they have even less credibility than before they     became prominent.          People are people are people.  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live  their life   Are you god tm    If so  fancy a date Heres pretty obvious dodge  do you really think youve said anythingor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement  I am nottelling anyone anything  I am demonstrating that there are argumentsagainst the practice of homosexuality  providing its a merely analternate lifestlye  that are not homophobic  that one can reasonablycall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realizeof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis  but if youare to be consistent  you have no case in this regard.       To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to     ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of     the homosexual  life style . But since the charge is only intended to     intimidate  its really just demogoguery and not to be taken     seriously. Fact is  Jim  there are far more persuasive arguments for     suppressing homosexuality than those given  but consider this a start.         Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the  bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by  a  bastard  to eternal damnation   Or someone who crushes his penis  either  accidently or not..  .  Both are in Deuteronomy.Im sure your comment pertains to something  but youve disguised itso well I cant see what. Where did I mention ideals  out dated orotherwise  Your arguments are very reactionary  do you have anythingat all to contribute        As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in     scouting  the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from     teaching  by their own logic  homosexuals are deviates  social and     biological. Since any adult is a role model for a child  it is     incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from     those who would do the child harm. In this case  harm means primarily     social  though that could be extended easily enough.              You show me  anyone  who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as  normal  and will take of my hat  Puma baseball cap  to you.   One mans meat  is another mans poison    What has this got to do with anything  Would you pick a single pointthat you find offensive and explain your objections  I would reallylike to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly.Bill

We slowed down  but after looking back to see the vandals standing there  we drove on to the police station. She did get a good look at the guy and saw him  cock his arm  with something the size of a cinderblock  BUT I never saw him. We are  VERY lucky the truck sits up high on the road  if it would have hit her window  it would have killed her.  The police are looking for the guy  but in all likelyhood he is gone.  I am a very good driver  knock on wood   but it was night time and I never saw the guy.

The justice for the victims of the Armenian Barbarism and Fascism ,Reply To  sera zuma.UUCP  Serdar Argic Distribution  worldLines  102In article  66118 licre.ludwig.edu.au  THEO licre.ludwig.edu.au writes            First of all  it is called ISTANBUL.            Let me even spell it for you  I S T A N B U L                                                                      Secondly  The Turks are also asking for their money  for            their destroyed and confiscated properties in Greece  and            former Yugoslavia  Bosnia and Serbia . Classic   It is called The Justice. We also demand that the x Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide  render reparations to the Muslim people  and return the land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further  and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed. Now if were talking about rent and vandalism  lets make it fair then   Greece pays back its dues and Turkey pays for 400 years rent and  destruction of classical architecture. Deal  Democracy in action.Are you the truelove or falselove of Arromdian of the ASALA SDPA ARFTerrorism and Revisionism Triangle   If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam thenations which they brought under their power  to which no one could haveopposed  today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody  to worship in their ownway  centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefsdiffered from theirs  the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where theinquisition did not exist  where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian     Turkeywas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhereby the Christians  could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslimcountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christiancountries.  1  The Turks  who are a conquering nation  did not Turkify the nations that cameunder their rule  instead  they respected their religions and traditions. Itwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead ofRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been aRomanian nation today   Popescu Ciocanel . Turks rule over people under their administration only externally  withoutinterfering with their internal structures. On account of this  the autonomyof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the mostadvanced European countries.  2  ...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flawis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examplesof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on accountof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case ofsimple contempt among us too  or if it did not keep translating itself intoaction  many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselveshappy    A. de Mortraye . 3  Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of theinquisition. On the contrary  it served as an asylum for the unfortunatevictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history  you will see thatin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain andPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have beenliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against thecruelty of Christians  especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able toappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens  even today. In Turkey however  if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection.  In that vast and calm country of the sultan  all religions and nations areliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church andthe synagogue  it does not replace them. Because of this  the Catholic sect ismore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open air ceremonies of this sect  neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While thedead are being taken to the graves  a long line of priests bear processionalcandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches inthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clericalprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations  chanting hymns and bearingtheir crosses and religious banners  a detachment of soldiers escorts themwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests.

An Anecdote about Islam,Organization  Technical University Braunschweig  GermanyLines  76In article  115687 bu.edu jaeger buphy.bu.edu  Gregg Jaeger  writes   deletion  Sure. Yes  I did. You see I dont think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly. You  being so interested in leniency for leniencys sake  apparently think that people should simply be told the  did a _bad_ thing.   Straw man. And you brought up leniency.    And what about the simple chance of misjudgements   Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible. I suspect that its pretty unlikely that  given my requirement of repeated offenses  that misjudgments are very likely.  Assuming that misjudgements are not correlated.   Deletion   I just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers  not to call each others names. In this case  to substantiate it  The Quran  allows that one beATs ones wife into submission.   Really  Care to give chapter and verse  We could discuss it.  Has been discussed here. Chapter and verse were cited  I assume that youwerent looking then. Lets be more exact  do you think it is not in the Quran . And what wouldyour consequences be when it it was shown to be in it     Primitive Machism refers to  that.  I have misspelt that before  my fault .  Again  not all of the Orient follows the Quran. So youll have to do better than that.  I have not claimed that. It is sufficient for the argument when there area lot of male dominated societies that qualify as Machistic. Are you goingto say that the situation of women is better in sufficeint areas of theOrient    Deletion  This is an argument for why _you_ dont like religions that suppress sex. A such its an irrelevant argument.  If youd like to generalize it to an objective statement then fine. My response is then  you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion  one of your  arguments  .  The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner.  You apparently have trouble reading things you dont like. The point washaving sex the way one wishes being a strong desire. Marriage is a redherring. Tell me about homosexuals  for one. You simply ignore everythingthat doesnt fit into the world as you would like to have it. And as for the situation of adolescents  one has probably keep yourcombination of leniency and maiming in mind  whe you say that it doesnot take  overly  strong measures to suppress the urge for sex inadolescents.

   Ten questions to Israelis,"Organization  Thinking Machines Corporation  Cambridge MA  USALines  169Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  composer.think.comIn article  1483500352 igc.apc.org   Center for Policy Research  cpr igc.apc.org  writes       From  Center for Policy Research  cpr          To   shaig Think.COM         Dear Shai       In the answer to my first question  concerning the nonexistence of   Israeli nationality  your answer conflicts with information I have   received from other quarters  according to which there are two   distinct categories of classifying Israelis   Citizenship    Ezrahut  and Nationality  Leum . The former is used on passports   etc  and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I   am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all   times and present them at many public places  almost every day.   These ID cards make clear who the holder is  a Jew or an Arab.   You maintain that this mainly because of religious services   provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason     Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it   serves no other purpose  A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the mannerin which the cards are used.  True  by law  all residents  citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  Forcitizens  the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serveson a daily basis  wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes placein banks  cashing checks   post offices  registered mail and such   etc...Quite frankly  it was rare that I ever had to present my ID cardfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law orrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.Furthermore  none of the services I outlined discriminate againstthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.The only case that I can think of in which the Leum field mightbe taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario.  In general though  arab citizens areclearly recognizable  as are non arabs. Your argument thereforebecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this fieldis being used to discriminate against them officially.   In the answer to my second questions  concerning the fact that   Israel has no fixed borders  you state that Israels borders were   shaped and reshaped by both war and peace. According to what I   read  the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century  had   plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into   Transjordan  Jordan . I also read that it was the express wish of   Ben Gurion to not declare Israels borders  when Israel was   established  as this might restrict Israels opportunities for   later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the   fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the   land to them. But according to biblical sources  the area God   promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the   borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use   today    Finally  if Israel wants peace  why cant it declare what   it considers its legitimate and secure borders  which might be a   base for negotiations  Having all the above facts in mind  one   cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism  as a   number of wars have proved  1948  1956  1967  1982 .I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countriesdo know that they have nothing to fear from  Israeli expansionism .Militarily  Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts ofland under occupation to a hostile  armed  and insurgent population for asustained period of time.  As is  the intifada is heavily taxingthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeliwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from theAwali  and later from the Litani  in order to control the minimalstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifadavia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring frombattle fatigue of sorts and the govt is aware of it.With regards to borders  let me state the following.  I may not agreewith the manner in which negotiations are being held  however the cruxof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from statinga starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawaland a return to pre 48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to statesmaller borders  then the arab countries might try and force even smallerborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to besettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realisticand sensible.   Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public   official. I dont think your answer is honest.  You refer me to   Vanunus revelations about Israels nuclear arsenal without   evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said   the truth  then why should he been punished  and if he lied  why   should he be punished  I would appreciate more honesty.Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a  center forpolicy research .  Whether or not all of Vanunus revelations were true has nobearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing  state secrets after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding thatsaid secrets are not to be made public  one should be punished.As to which were and which werent  I am under no moral obligationto disclose that   quite the reverse in fact.He was taken to court  tried  and found guilty.  You may take issuewith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of theconcept of  Secrets of state   something which every democratic govthas.   Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question  concerning   hidden prisoners in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from   Maariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do   exist in Israel. What do you think about that  I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could existmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted which you evidently did not pay attention to  that they know of no suchreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill as tightly knit as Israel  even if the matter of the arrest was notmade public  within a relatively short time frame  most people would knowabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should bemade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that anannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a   way to cast aspersions upon Israel. Such terms have often been   used by the Soviet Union against dissidents  They call the Soviet   Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing  they   would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are   clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be   very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about   Israel were just fabrications  but alas you have failed to do so.   I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest   discussion. This is a sign of weakness  not of strength.Well  I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Suchquestions are often termed  tabloid journalism  and are notdisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era asa basis for the witch hunts that took place then.  To useyour own example  these questions might have been liftedfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were lookingfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portrayas a larger and dirtier picture.My answers were not any more  hysterical  than the questionsthemselves.  The problem is not that the qs were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  Youfall into the same category of those who seek  yes   no  answerswhen the real answer is  of sorts .I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not anunequivocal NO  you would remain unsatified and choose to interpretethem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to lookYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocatedculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer  only to find that theyhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environmentthey sought to protect.

Proton Centaur ,"Organization  stanfordLines  59In article  1993Apr21.190156.7769 lmpsbbs.comm.mot.com   dennisn ecs.comm.mot.com  Dennis Newkirk  writes    In article  1993Apr20.211638.168730 zeus.calpoly.edu  jgreen trumpet.calpoly.edu  James Thomas Green  writes     Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a Proton Centaur combo     What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo  other    than the obvious instability in the XSSR now           The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton    is 4 so thats a good fit for their existing upper stage  the Block D   which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I dont know about   launch loads  etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which   are probably worse than the Proton  those Titan SRBs probably shake things   up pretty good  it seems feasible. EXCEPT  the Centaur is a very fragile   thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.   Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know    how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while   bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track   and erected on the pad   The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4 Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. Youve hit on the real kicker  however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to      5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions when I was there 88 91  the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non pressure stabilized centaur. The answer    a centaur not worth launching. The Atlas Centaur does not require on pad integration  however the T4 Centaurdoes. I believe the on pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration  so maybe something can be done there........      They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads     unless the new Proton second stage is actually built   and of course   any Centaur support systems and facilities  no doubt imported from the   US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political   problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. The addition of LOX LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I dont know what the proton uses for fuel  but since they are derived from ICBMs I would suspect that they use storable propellants which dont have the ullage problem that cryos do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all  the addition of these systems could be big     not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea.    H.D.

Educational Pricing,Article I.D.  reed.1993Apr15.234121.6655Organization  Reed College  Portland  OregonLines  36In article  1993Apr15.134938.1 jaguar.csc.wsu.edu  f0975893 jaguar.csc.wsu.edu writes  In article  C5Iz7n.Kyv cs.dal.ca   hayes ug.cs.dal.ca  Kevin B. Hayes  writes    you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational   prices.   I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices  I went for a retailer  actually mail order  CDA computers   because its price was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center   the CPU was a resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non standard number  probably from CDA computers . Consequently  the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy  was I pi  ed  Moral of the story  CAVEAT EMPTOR. Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.  As a result mail ordercompanies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who havemore machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairsby overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a betterwholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serialnunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower pricesthatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealercost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costsand trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well. The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowestprices available from authorised local dealers.They are even further away from educational prices. ERik Speckman

Being right about messiahs,Organization  MIND LINK    British Columbia  CanadaLines  39I must have missed the postings about Waco  David Koresh  and the SecondComing.  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing  unless theperson claiming to be IT is obviously insane Im not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How couldsomebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming   Koresh did promise thathe would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radiobroadcast.  He didnt.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.And  from my meagre knowledge of the Bible  it seems that Christians havebeen hard on the Jews of Christs day for being cautious about acceptingsomebody that their religious authorities didnt accept as the Messiah.So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to beearly to recognize the Second Coming while  at the same time  not wanting tobe credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God. Mark 13 21   And then if any one says to you  Look  here is the Christ  or Look  there he is  do not believe it. Mark 13 22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders  to lead astray  if possible  the elect. Mark 13 23   But take heed  I have told you all things beforehand. Mark 13 24     But in those days  after that tribulation  the sun will be darkened  and the moon will not give its light  Mark 13 25   and the stars will be falling from heaven  and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. Mark 13 26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. My understanding of Jesus answer is that  unlike his first coming which was veiled  the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  Hestelling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happenbefore his second coming    the actual second coming will make hispower openly visible.By the way  from Koreshs public statement its not so clear to methat he is claiming to be Christ.  clh

Anyone have any ideas       I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine  not the network itself. To give you a real world example  here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes  novell file servers  and each other. Its not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet  with maybe 4 concentrators  so you have 20 30 people on each segment . If you had a badly loaded net  or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive  you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it  youre going to see some slowdowns because youre now on  effectively  a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course  DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice  but if you have 10 working programs running  youll know it. Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use though  ISDN 64K  is costly and the bandwidth limited.  Thats why myinterest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic goes through it. Having said that  if you can tweak the programs being run  by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing   you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again  this time from network bandwidth .Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all   Are yourunning any standard MS Windows programs like Word    What sort of packets go blazing through  What size link do you have  2Mb or 10Mb   .What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do youhave few high peaks and then many low points  It all really depends on what the programs are doing  ie. youre going to see a slowdown from X bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...     What do you mean by network things   I vision using MS Windows and otherWindows applications over the network were the processes are running onthe server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how good is the X and subsequently DV X protocol in transferring these images with X calls and displaying them on a clients machine.

Art of clutchless shifting,Organization  ARP SoftwareLines  30jong halcyon.com  Barking Weasel  writes   schludermann sscvx1.ssc.gov writes    My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently  wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window   I lightly press the accelerator   try agian. Ive found that clutchless  shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms  4000 7000 . I also skip gears some  times using 1 3 5  1 2 4 5.          Sounds about right.  I usually slip it out during throttle down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right  usually about a second  and then slip it into gear...    So  how did you guys  learn  this  Is it something you wereborn with  or did you make horrible grinding noises the first fewtimes   how many times      I would think youd have to have a certain amount of  feel for it to begin with. Some people would never get it  and others like me  would never have the guts to try it  unless maybe youwere planning to buy a new transmission anyway...

Clintons views on Jerusalem,"Organization  University of Denver  Dept. of Math   Comp.

According to the article  Mr. Clinton reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However  during recent talks with President Mubarak  Secretary of State Christopher stated that  the status of Jerusalem will be a final matter of discussion between the parties . Now I dont want to start a big discussion over the status of Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can  authenticate Mr. Clintons statements with dates  places  etc.From a recent interview in Middle East Insight magazine Clinton said that he supports moving the US Embassy toJerusalem  but would not do so at this time because itwould interrupt the peace talks.   msilverm nyx.cs.du.edu				GO CUBS    One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball    Geddy Lee"

Were Mad as Hell at the TV News ,"Organization  Manes and Associates  NYCX Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL9 Lines  168Jim De Arras  jmd cube.handheld.com  wrote     Last year the US suffered almost 10 000 wrongful or accidental    deaths by handguns alone  FBI statistics .  In the same year  the UK    suffered 35 such deaths  Scotland Yard statistics .  The population    of the UK is about 1 5 that of the US  10 000    35   5  .  Weighted    for population  the US has 57x as many handgun related deaths as the    UK.  And  no  the Brits dont make up for this by murdering 57x as    many people with baseball bats.  You just cant compare this way   All homicides must be shown  per capita  not    just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred    murder weapon  but ban them  and some other weapon will step in as the    favorite.As a  favorite   sure.  As lethal  not likely.  A study of violence inChicago produced this table 		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks			    Resulting in Death			    	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks	                                                               	Knives  16 518 total attacks 		 2.4	Guns  6 350 total attacks 		12.2	Source  Firearms and Violence in American Life	It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of gunsthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this wereso  knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicidewould be expected to show a low fatality rate  and knife attacks incities where guns were not so widely used  like Vancouver  would showa higher fatality rate.  But the Natl Commission on the Causes andPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found thisnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knifeattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants  the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to theproportion of gun attacks.  In fact  the reverse was true.What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination onthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tendedto show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do gravephysical injury  multiple stabs wounds  wounds concentrated about thehead neck and chest  etc.  Most gun homicides did not show thispattern.  Rather  more fatal attacks were committed during a moment ofrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.	Source  Report on Firearms and Violence  Then  since England    USA  my ancestors left because of the oppression  you    must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to    be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs     so there are no drug gangs battling for turf  etc.  there.  If you drop out the    drug related killings here  the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually  Im notfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans andAmericans. There are more cultural  beahvioral and economicdifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of foundmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  Idont think we could ever attain the low levels of European violentcrime here in the US  whether we banned guns or required everylaw abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.On the other hand  we can draw lessons from neighbors who are moreculturally similar  namely the Canadians.  In fact  an exhaustive seven year study has already been done of the respective crime ratesof Vancouver  British Columbia and Seattle  Washington... citieswith roughly the same population  urban economy  geographyand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.In Seattle  handguns may be purchased legally for self defense.  Aftera 30 day waiting period  a permit can be obtained to carry a concealedweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.In Vancouver  self defense is not considered a valid or legal reasonto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.Recreational uses of handguns  target shooting  collecting  areregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires arestricted weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained inorder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handgunstransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.In short  gun control but not unreasonably so.Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions forgun related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchersstudied all cases of robbery  assault  simple and aggravated  burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from1 1 80 to 12 31 86. In defining the cases  they used the samestandard  the FBIs Unified Crime Report.Results  during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery inSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver 1.09   1.11 .  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates  .99 .18 925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12 034 inVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault inSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver  1.18  1.15  and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher 1.16   1.12 .  However  when aggravated assaults were subdivided byweapon and the mechanism of assault  a clear pattern emerged.Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravatedassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons  firearms werefar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact  7.7 times as often.Over the seven year study  388 homicides occurred in Seattle 11.3 per 100 000  vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver  6.9 per 100 000 .After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle  ascompared to Vancouver  was found to be 1.63.When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death  the rateof homicide by knives and other weapons  excluding firearms  inSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due toa more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handgunsaccounted for roughly 85  of homicides involving firearms.  Handgunswere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle thanin Vancouver.The authors of the report also investigated  legally justifiable homicides  self defense .  Only 32 such homicides occurred duringthe seven year study  11 of which were committed by police.  Only21 cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred  17 inSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  Afterexcluding these cases  there was virtually no impact on theseearlier findings.       This is  I feel  a very fair report.  One might even make theargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole becauseVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three timesthat of Ottawa  Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reportsannual homicide rates only half to two thirds that of NYC Chicago  Los Angeles and Houston.Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal accessto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide becausepersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire agun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more bythe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons  wecould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns tobe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However  during the studyinterval  Vancouvers rate of homicide by weapons other than gunswas not significantly higher than that in Seattle  suggesting thatfew would be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.As well  ready access to handguns for self defense by law abidingcitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle didexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self defense  thesecases accounted for less than 4  of the homicides in both citiesduring the course of the study period.  And  as was reported Seattle apparently didnt enjoy relief from any crime categoryover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves forself defense.

In the United States I generally read the NYT  and occasionally  a mainstream Israelinewpaper.   I read Arab  ISRAELI  Jer. Post  and this network is more than enough    and Western  American  French  and British  reports and I can say   that if we give Israel  10 and Arabs  10 on the bias scale  of course   you can switch the polarities  Israeli newspapers will get either   a  9 or  10  American leading  newspapers and TV news range from  6   to  10  yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis    The Montreal suburban  a local free newspaper  probably is closer   to Kahanes views than some Israeli right wing newspapers  British   range from 0  neutral  to  10  French  that Iknow of  of course  range   from  2  Afro french magazines  to  10  Arab official media range from   0 to  5  Egyptian   to  9 in SA. Why no  10  Because they do not want to   overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since    they are doing nothing.What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longerrepresentative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a fewyears ago and in the battle for control  most of the liberal andleft wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past more than once  that the JPs task should be geared towards explainingand promoting Israels position  more than attacking the govt  Likudat the time .  The paper that I would recommend reading  being middlestream and factual is  Ha Aretz    or at least this was the case twoyears ago.   the average bias of what you read would be probably around  9    while that of the average American would be the same if they do   not read or read the new york times and similar News makers  and    8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.And what about the  Natl Enquirer   8  But seriously  if one were to read some of the leftist newspapersone could arrive at other conclusions.

The arrogance of Christians,Organization  University of Canterbury  Christchurch  New Zealand.Lines  68Carol Alvin  caralv caralv.auto trol.com  wrote   In the New Testament  sorry I dont have a Bible at work  and cant  provide a reference   women are instructed to be silent and cover  their heads in church.  Now  this is scripture.  By your definition    this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak   Do they cover their heads   If all  scripture is absolute truth  it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet  clearly  women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.   At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.   Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.   And there are plenty of other examples.  Can you reconcile this The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things aboutthe Bible which they dont actually believe or practice. Ive knownall sorts of Christians  ranging from the trendiest of liberals tothe fire breathing fundamentalists  and although many on the conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible isa  perhaps  the   source of absolute truth  I dont know of anyonewho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.While I am not a Roman Catholic  I believe this is close to the officialposition of the RC church  perhaps an RC would like to comment .The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained interms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat and cane and give you some big song and dance routine about why this  other passages as well  arent directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they actually practice are two different things  but mostly it doenst.While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy  in thiscase  making claims about the Bible which the claimants dont actuallyput into practice. But if we step back from the name calling andlook at what people are attempting to say  we see that they are tryingto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within theChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as  Word ofGod    inerrant    infallibale    The Manufacturers Handbook    Theonly rule of faith and practice in the church today  to describe theBible  we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look atthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratablyfalse and others are self contradictory  but in my experience people aregenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker evenwhen the speakers words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblicalexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks  Where are you   and Adamexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam hadanswered Gods words he would have said something like  Im here in thistree.  The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that thesewords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most peoplehave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding ofthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrasesand explanations that others use.I hope this helps.                                                                       ___Bill Rea                                                             o o                                                                    w  U  w     Bill Rea  Computer Services Centre    E Mail   b.rea csc.canterbury.ac.nz    University of Canterbury              or     cctr114 csc.canterbury.ac.nz    Christchurch  New Zealand             Phone  03  642 331 Fax  03  642 999

ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH  NO SURVIVORS   ,"Distribution  worldOrganization  Memphis State UniversityLines  49In article  93109.13404334AEJ7D CMUVM.BITNET    34AEJ7D CMUVM.BITNET  writes   CNN is reporting as I write this that the ATF has ignited all  the buildings of the Branch Dividian ranch near Waco  TX. The  lies from ATF say  holes were made in the walls and non lethal tear  gas pumped in . A few minutes after this started the whole thing went up.  ALL buildings are aflame. NO ONE HAS ESCAPED. I think it obvious that  the ATF used armored flame thrower vehicles to pump in unlit  napalm  then let the wood stove inside ignite it.Well  actually  the Davidians  Koreshians   started the fire themselves  the last I heard   around 15 00 EST . Eight people ran out into the feildssurrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the fire. I dont buy your napalm theory at all  although it would have made a great commercial for my .sig . Why the hell would they have a wood stoveburning on such a warm day   Flame throwers use liquid petroleum  napalm is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory  the diluted CS gaswas inserted around 06 00 if I understood correctly. The place didnt startburning until around 10 00 or 11 00.   THIS IS MURDER  ATF MURDERERS   BUTCHERS    THIS IS GENOCIDAL MASS SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE  INCLUDING CHILDREN   I have predicted this from the start  but God  it sickens me to see  it happen. I had hoped I was wrong. I had hoped that there was  still some shred of the America I grew up with  and loved  left  alive. I was wrong. The Nazis have won. Calm down kid. Vernon  Koreshs real name  said himself that he would not leavethat compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.  I REPEAT  AS OF THIS TIME THERE ARE   NO  SURVIVORS   There are at least eight survivors. A caller on Rush Limbaugh today suggestedthat the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. Thats not such a wildidea considering their weaponry and resolve.   God help us all.  PLEASE CROSSPOST    DONT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF THE   CHILDREN   W. K.

New Study Out On Gay Percentage,Organization  ITC UVA Community Access UNIX Internet ProjectLines  50In article  15378 optilink.com  cramer optilink.COM  Clayton Cramer  writes    From the Santa Rosa  Cal.

B2       Male sex survey  Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior  the most thorough     examination of American mens sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago  shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.1  So what 2  It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers   gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of   us then this is an event unprecidented in history... The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20 39 was 7.3.Dont forget that 25  had 20 or more partners.... Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters  Johnson  and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners  it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for thosewho said they where homosexual  Or is that number to inconvient foryou....

Even blanks  which have no projectile  can cause death if themuzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber orplastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations  where theintent is crowd control  rather than close range self defense   ive alsoseen reports of deaths caused by them  the British in Northern Ireland . Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in thegravest of situations  at that point  i consider deadly  lethal  force to be a proper reaction  and so does the law .   Furthermore  use of less effective  but still potentially lethal  forcehas its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of theless effective force to stop the incident  this places all parties at somerisk  the victim because the attack has not stopped  and the assailent since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well bemore deadly.

I dont know how muchthe teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps thetuchus steerers. I was one  I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding  after  the course.I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem  but I onlystarted using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed off ramps and the like  was a lot more difficult that it should have been.I knew how it works  although thats currently up for debate  definitely knew that  it works  as I could do it in swerves  but only figured it out laterin my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that its not a bad idea tobring the idea up  but its best to let everyone tuchus steer for the firstlesson or two  so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worryabout proper handlebar technique. countersteering.  In fact  my Experienced Rider Course instructors claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight around  even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite direction.   I admit Ive never actually seen this. I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime duringthe lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike  and the studentwould take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the you are a sack of potatoes  passenger speech  the instructor would steerthe bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch Im just happy that it didnt happen to me.Ive        bike                      like         Jody Levine  DoD  275 kV     got a       you can        if you       PF    Jody.P.Levine hydro.on.ca                         ride it                   Toronto  Ontario  Canada

And that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go  around.  Who would you rather have as your  checking  centre   Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis   For that matter I would take either Gretzky or Mario as my  checking  centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey  Gretzky  Lemieux  Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If theywere used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensiveabilities. When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis  Gainey etc you are comparing apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isnt very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead ofhim.  Sure Lemieux is a better player  but he is a different type ofplayer.  For a team to be successful  they need to have all types ofplayers  this includes defensive forwards.When compared with other defensive forwards  Bob Gainey is the greatestdefensive forward ever.  He is the player whos talents best suited beinga defensive forward  who completely dominated the game when he played.Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste hisoffensive talents and play defensively  he could have been a betterdefensive forward  but he wasnt.Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.Gregmeister

And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia  and most of europe   we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.That you know of.While I lived in the DBR  a gang robbed a joint US Army Bundewehr armoury andgot several hundred M 16s  ammunition  handguns and some explosives.  When Ileft two years later  there were no clues.  Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one  What I meant was that cars CAN kill  but they are not GUNS  Someone said that if we ban guns wed have to ban cars to  because they kill to... I dont think we should argue on this one.....     The issue  I hope..   I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. Guns are not a problem  but the way they are used is....  and what are they for   Who uses them is the problem.  Crime  in the U.S.  is  no big deal  if you arethe criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served  in jail waiting for trial  and you are out in 12 months  worst case.  If we would putcriminals  especially violent ones  in the slam for true sentences  crime woulddrop.  Instead  we reward them for being good and let them out early  veryearly.  I think this discusion is interesting when you think of  ex Jugoslavia  They should all have weapons  its their rigth to have them  and if they use them to kill other  Innocent  people the problem is humans  not guns.Serbs  Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before theinvention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is ahatred that goes beyond reason.  If 50  of ALL murders was done with axes  would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees  and that the axe is not a problem  its the axer     An example  dont flame me just because not exactly 50  are killed by guns... Yes  the problem is the user.  Question back  since you are one of the rationalones    If all gun crime were to stop  would you support dropping all guncontrols   Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. Is this a good situation    Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem   They did not believe  from experience  that the  police   including NationalGuard  could would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human beingdoes not have a right to protect him herself  they did the right thing.  Whatwould you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks  andalso likely armed with stolen firearms   If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals  and their neighbor who have guns  what do you think will happen     I mean if everybody had a gun in USA Criminals would move to Scandinavia         The average criminal would look fora less hazardous job  and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.  Dont flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland  they have gun control that works  in England  and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents...  Something about throwing stones in glass houses... Personally  I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to  make Irelandfree .  Of course  this is the last thing the IRA wants  because they losepower if England pulls out.  But thats for another group. Dont flame them because of what to  three   children did either.The U.S. has roughly 20 times the major sporting events as the U.K..  How manyriots did we have at sporting events last year  off the playing field   Hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here.  I guessthats where the different cultures thing comes in.  Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace     YES  Yes.  The question is  is the problem one of too many guns  mostly from thearmy  or not enough  nonSerbians can not defend themselves.   My numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot guns are from the police and the Statistisk Sentralbyraa   understood that one Sorenson     LAST WORD  Responsible gun owners are not a problem  but they will be affected if you want to protect  your citicens.But disarming responsible gun owners is not the solution.

How good does their rotation look   The last I heard  the order is Tapani  Erikson  Mahomes  Banks  and some guy Ive never heard of.   sounds pretty pathetic to me Well  maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year old prospect who  hasnt matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year old who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young  and have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim Deshaies  formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies hasnt looked very good this spring  so I believe that the spot has gone to Trombley  although they hadnt wanted 3 starters this unproven. I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.  2.  Who is playing short and third Well  Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year  but was a SS in the minors  and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is split  maybe  between Pagliarulo  who has had a great spring  and Terry Jorgenson  a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 years.  Im not sure how the time will be divided  but they seem to be happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson  but I fear they might give too much time to Pags.  3.  Hows Winfield doing Sorry  cant help you here.Dennis

So  this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.   They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine.Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killedin the  O.T. .  It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak ofthe intifada  palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating theirdemonstrations for the benefit of the media.  Having spoken to a Danishreporter who covered the initfada  I know of at least one case wherehe found out that a  mass demonstration  on the outskirts of Gaza wassetup for himself and his colleagues.

SATANIC TOUNGES,"Lines  38 pwhite empros.com  Peter White  relates a story about a person who gives a message in tongues which consists entirely of the words puka.  He was asked to refrain from doing that. Well  Brother Puka controlled himself for a while  but a few weeks later  the church had invited a missionary in to speak. At the time of the meeting where tongues and interpretation were appropriate  who  should arise to speak but Brother Puka. And off he went as before  all the words were Puka. The pastor was about to apologize for this embarrassment when the missionary arose to speak saying that he was sorry that he did not have the interpretation but that he could give the translation. In a tribe where he had worked  they only had one word in the language  puka. Meaning was derived from the inflection and other voice qualities. Brother Puka had given a perfectly inflected and reasonable message.Nice story but it sets off my urban legend  or is it charismaticlegend   alarms.  Can the linguists on the net identify the languagefrom the description   Or can they even attest that such a languageexists.  It seems to be odd enough  at least by the standards ofEuropean languages  that if it exists  it should be reasonably wellknown to linguists as an extreme case of something or other.Or have I just overreacted to your basic shaggy dog story Will                                                                               William Taber           Will_Taber dg.com 	    Any opinions expressed    Data General Corp.      will futon.webo.dg.com    are mine alone and may    Westboro  Mass. 01580                             change without notice.

IC Packages,"Organization  Megatest CorporationLines  58In article  1993Apr16.142715.12613 sol.ctr.columbia.edu  seema madvlsi.columbia.edu  Seema Varma  writes  Hi  	I am looking for some help in choosing a package for a high speed silicon ADC  100Mhz  currently being  fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do DC  low speed and high speed testing using 3 different set ups for the test chip.  	 	I know for sure that a DIP will not work  the long lead lines have too high an inductance . Getting a custom made package is too expensive  so I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard to test since it has to be soldered on to the test setup and I would spend loads of time soldering  as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may not work at high speeds.   	Does anyone out there have experience knowledge of this field   I would greatly appreciate help  Any ideas  names of companies manufacturing holders sockets packages would help.    P.S. The multi layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit of overkill    	      Seema VarmaYou didnt mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Whereexactly are you running 100MHz    THe digital side   TTL ECL   We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment all day long in the ECL domain  and we use DIPs alongwith PLCCs  25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFPs to namea few.  I dont see a problem in packaging as longas you adhere to sound engineering practices.  A good source of information is Motorolas MECL System DesignHandbook. The latest ed. is dated 2 88.  That is consideredto be one of the  bibles  in high speed design.The very fact that you need to build a test fixture meansyoure most likely going to need a socket.  It in itselfhas far more inductance per pin than the package you aretesting  not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  Idont see the big concern over the packaging because itprobably isnt going to make that much differenceIf youre trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz  have fun...TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.   aaronP.S.

Peltier Effect Heat Pumps,"Reply To  paj uk.co.gec mrc  Paul Johnson Organization  GEC Marconi Research Centre  Great Baddow  EssexLines  45I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when Icame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for coolingcomponents.  For those who have not heard of this effect  you put acurrent through one of these devices  and it pumps heat from one sideto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  Ithink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.Anyway  it struck me that you could make a nice cool hot box forpicnics with one of these  a power regulator  a thermostat and acouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with anefficiency of 80 90   which aint bad  although it would flatten mycar battery in about half an hour .Unfortunately the catalogue didnt list anything more than the basicspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back EMF as thetemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so  presumablyits power decreases as the back EMF increases  until eventually wehave a steady state with no current being consumed  assuming noleakage .  If so  then the final temperature difference between thetwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it .What I would like to know is 1  Are the above guesses correct 2  What is the open circuit thermal resistance of a typical device     I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm   too fast when I unplug it 3  How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work   It looks like   magic 4  Why dont they use these things in domestic fridges freezers Thanks in advance Paul.Paul Johnson  paj gec mrc.co.uk .

Fractals  what good are they ,Organization  Rockwell InternationalX Newsreader  Tin 1.1 PL5Lines  16In regards to fractal commpression  I have seen 2 fractal compressed  movies .They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale  movie  ofCasablanca  it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a littlegrainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but ithad 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many other formats out there  you do end up losing resolution.  I dont know whatkind of software hardware was used for creating the  movies  I saw but the guythat showed them to me said it took 5 15 minutes per frame to generate.  But asI said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could youput 11 minutes on one floppy disk davidr rincon.ema.rockwell.comMy opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case I will probably change my mind.

You can rev that car all day  everyday  and youll never blow a hose  or crack the block  or anything else.  I speak from expierence   Im not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine  but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more  it is aa couple of things   blowing a hose doesnt speak of engine reliability  and while it is true that quad4s have a problem with head gasket leaks  that wasa design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected.  also i know pontiac isreplacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year 60k miles.  other thanthat i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition system means no wires rotor rotor cap to ever deal with.  also hydrolic liftersmean no valve adjustments ever.  im not badmouthing the integra engine  i justthink you are going overboard on slamming the quad4.  you are quite correctthat the integra engine is quieter  although i would not say smoother  myquad4 loves to rev  especially at the high end.  do you have any evidenceof blocks cracking on quad4s   i have not heard of this.

To me  the question really is not about dealer profit but the 	amount of money for the type of car. Ive settled with a 	new 92 Subaru Wagon with the similar amount of money a Saturn 	dealer asked for a SW1. OK  I know its a 92 model  but I think 	I got a better car  though I have to adjust my initial idea of  	why I am getting a new car .  	Today  during a conversion with a friend  I learned he rejected 	a Saturn for a Ford Tarurs  as it only costed him a little bit more 	than a SL2. I may be wrong  but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2.	I agree that a fully loaded SL2 would come close in price to aLOWER END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY LOADED Taurus  on the other hand  would stillbe substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loadedSL2 would run somewhere around  17 000  while a fully loaded Taurus LX would besomewhere around the  22 000  23 000 range.  A base Taurus  GL I believe  mightstart around  15 000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push  30 000if you really try  but this is a totally different car than your mainstreamTaurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty  just a littleinaccurate.  	I cant see Saturn is of better value and that is why I was puzzled 	by its pricings. Oh  we did not spend much time getting our deals  	being better informed has its advantages.Well  thats ok.  At least youre not bitching about dealer profits like someof the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car thatis best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced bythe Impreza wagon  so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones. 	 	Then again  I may be wrong.

Radio Electronics Free information card,"Nntp Posting Host  bopper2.phx.mcd.mot.comOrganization  Motorola Computer Group  Tempe  Az.Lines  73In article  C5uLqG.I5 acsu.buffalo.edu  v064mb9k ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu  NEIL B. GANDLER  writes   	How does the radio Electronics free information cards work. Do they just send you some general information about the companies that advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a catalog. That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards  then each advertisergets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readerswho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data onself adhesive labels  and the really big magazines provide thedata on computer disk.The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You willnotice that the Radio Electronics information card  commonly calleda  bingo card  in the industry  includes lines for a company nameand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big  nationaladvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals asbest they can. For example  if you include Motorola as your companyand include a business phone  and a mail stop   Tektronics will probablysend you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineercall you about a week later. If you leave it blank  odds are theywill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retailoutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you the whole catalog. And then some companies  like Digikey or Jameco  havenothing to mail out accept the catalog.A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards  Free  industrymagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. Theyuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do readthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or pushyou  through repeated mailings  to re subscribe. They also compilehow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that  23  of readersrequesting data were interested in capacitors.  And finally  somemagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. Forexample  Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested informationabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONICs  in the past 6 months.The other point  in the data the advertiser receives  many magazinesinclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want  theadvertiser can attempt to cull out the  literature collectors  fromthe serious potential customers. Can you say qualified sales leads  I thought you could. Whats the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards   Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more  than 8 items  use the second card and mail it a couple of  weeks later.  If you are really  really serious and you really  really want  the information  CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK  This will also  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data  on a computer printout.  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that youre  not really  qualified  for  send in a bingo card at least every  other month and circle two or three numbers.  Include a business name and phone number  even if its your house.  Advertisers almost never call.

Can you recommend me a particular brand  What price are we talking about For a good display  you  must  get an active matrix panel and a  very bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel  i.e.stage must not get too hot . I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and likedit  but I needed a brighter projector  I used it with a 3M 920 . It isalso too expensive for what you get  IMHO. Prices of active matrix panelsare rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year  something to dowith tarrifs being lifted I think . In Canadian dollars  the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about 5000 to  7000 and a good overhead projector about  1000 to  1500. Forthat kind of money  you can get a brighter image from a three beamprojector  but sacrifice portability.Oh yes  proper room lighting is extremely important  especially if youwant your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have thatlight wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right.

SIRTF Mission is Still Alive,Organization  Jet Propulsion LaboratoryLines  114Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  kelvin.jpl.nasa.govKeywords  SIRTF  JPLNews Software  VAX VMS VNEWS 1.41    From the  JPL Universe April 23  1993SIRTF is still very much in businessBy Mark Whalen     In these times of extra tight NASA budgets  the verysurvival of a number of missions has been uncertain. But thanksto major design refinements implemented in recent months  JPLsSpace Infrared Telescope Facility  SIRTF     a major projectconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago    is  aliveand well   according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.     A lighter spacecraft  revised orbit and shorter mission haveadded up to a less expensive project with  tremendous scientificpower  and a bright future  said Werner.     Designed as a follow up to the highly successful InfraredAstronomical Satellite  IRAS  and Cosmic Background Explorer COBE  missions  SIRTF    a cryogenically cooled observatory forinfrared astronomy from space    is scheduled for launch in 2000or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.     IRAS pioneering work in space based infrared astronomy 10years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as neverbefore and revealed  among other things  60 000 galaxies and 25comets. It provided a sky survey 1 000 times more sensitive thanany previously available from ground based observations. COBE hasmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on largeangular scales  and revealed new facts about the early universe.     But to illuminate SIRTFs potential  Jim Evans  JPLsmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre Projects recently said that the project is  1 000 to 1 million times morecapable than IRAS   based on technological advances in infrareddetector arrays.     However  despite the enormous strides in infraredexploration SIRTF promised  and the fact that it was cited as thehighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s by the National Academy of Sciences   it took a  diet or die directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the projectgoing  according to Werner.     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF  based on the keyfactor in its new design  The satellite will orbit the suninstead of the Earth  permitting the use of an Atlas rocketlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan.  Themain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of yourlaunch capability for boosting the payload    you dont have tocarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit   Werner said.The other advantage to a solar orbit  he said  is that  its in abetter thermal environment  away from the heat of the Earth.      Additional major changes in SIRTFs redesign includeshortening the mission from five to three years and building aspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the originalplan    Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2 470 kilograms  5 400 pounds compared to Titan SIRTFs 5 500 kilograms  12 100 pounds .     All of that adds up to  a less stressful launchenvironment   Werner said  and a cost savings of more than  200million for the launch  in addition to increased savings in thedesign of the smaller  less massive spacecraft.     Werner said SIRTFs redesign came as a result of Congresstelling NASA  youre trying to do too many things. If you want usto support SIRTF  which is a good project  develop a plan to seehow it fits into  NASAs  overall strategy.      Shortly thereafter  SIRTF was named as NASAs highestpriority  flagship  scientific mission by the interdisciplinarySpace Sciences Advisory Committee  in addition to the blessingfrom the National Academy of Sciences.     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descopingto keep the project alive  SIRTFs major scientific contributionalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detectorarrays  which will allow images to be developed  tens ofthousands of times faster  than before  according to Evans.      Up until a couple of years ago   Werner said   all infraredastronomy was done with single detectors    or very small arraysof individually assembled detectors. Since then  the Departmentof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens orhundreds of thousands of detectors  rather than just a few  andthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF.      Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budgetpressures  Congress is currently watching NASA projects with aneye out for any  technological spinoff.       On that question  I think we have some things to say   hesaid   because the detectors were using are straight off variousmilitary developments. Also  SIRTF will be built by the U.S.aerospace industry  and its a real technological and engineeringchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.      SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community  Werner added  but the revised three year mission  puts a premiumon observing time. We have to educate the user community anddevelop a program that involves early surveys and quickturnaround of the data.      Werner said the downsizing of the project required areduction in scope and complexity of SIRTFs three instruments   the infrared spectrograph  infrared array camera and multibandimaging photometer. However  these reductions will only result inlosses of efficiency rather than capability  he said.     The project hopes to start a  Phase B  activity in 1995 which will provide a detailed concept for development and design.Building the hardware would begin about two years later.     Projected cost estimates  Evans said  are  850 million  950million.      I am very optimistic about SIRTF   he said.  It willprovide a tremendous return for the investment.      Werner added that an additional benefit from the projectwill be the  enrichment of our intellectual and culturalenvironment. People on the street are very interested inastronomy ... black holes  the possibility of life on otherplanets  the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind ofquestions SIRTF will help answer.                                       ___    _____     ___     _      ____      _        Ron Baalke           baalke kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov             __                Jet Propulsion Lab   ___         __           __   M S 525 3684 Telos   The aweto from New Zealand ___         ___         __    Pasadena  CA 91109   is part caterpillar and _____     _          _____                         part vegetable.

Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same  mandate territory    read colony.	And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syriantroops controlling the country.  Until Syria leaves  and freeelections take place  its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanesewould even be involved in determining what happens to their country. Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.	I expect you will agree that the same holds true for Syriahaving no right to be in Lebanon    	Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the 1967 war.   These areas are not occupied  but disputed  since there is no   legitamate governing body.  Citizenship was given to those residents   in annexed areas who wanted citizenship. The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth  excluding one small caribean island .	The UN also thought Zionism is racism.  That fails to make it true.   	The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes   it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements also   act as fortresses in times of war.  Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks 	They lasted weeks against tanks in 48  and stopped thosetanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in 73.  There is littleevidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.	They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations takeplace over the Jordan river  the existance of large  patrolledkibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area  where they areusually picked up in the morning.   	A second reason was political.  Creating  settlements  brought   the arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns and   cities gone on another several years  there would be no place left in   Israel where there was an arab majority.  There would have been no   land left that could be called arab. Dont fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.	Nonsense.  Israel has been trying to get its neighbors to thenegotiating table for 40 years.  It was the gulf war that brought thearabs to the table  not the Israelis.   	The point is  there are many reasons people moved over the   green line  and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whatever   status is negotiated for disputed territories  it will not be an  all   or nothing  deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation  not   be the results of a war. Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.	Nonsense.  According to Arafat  Israel must be destroyed.  Hehas never come clean and denied that this is his plan.  He alwayswaffles on what he means.	  When the Arabs set off their volcano  there will only be Arabs in	this part of the world.  Our people will continue to fuel the torch	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the	occupied homeland is liberated...

Enzyme studies and urine analyses have not turned up anything out of the ordinary.  MRI images of the brain show scar tissue in the white matter.  Subsequent MRI analysis has shown that the deterioration of the white matter is progressive.  Because neither family has a history of anything like this  and because two of our four children are afflicted with the disorder  we believe that it is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of some kind.  Naturally  we would like to know exactly what the disease is so that we may gain some insight into how we can expect the disorder to progress in the future.  We would also like to be able to provide our normal children with some information about what they can expect in their own children. It could be one of the leukodystrophies  not adrenal  onlyboys get that .  Surely youve been to a university pediatricneurology department.  If not that is the next step.  Biopsiesmight help  especially if peripheral nerves are also affected.There are so many of these diseases that would fit the symptomsyou gave that more cant be said at this time.I agree with your surmise that it is an autosomal recessive.If so  your normal children wont have to worry too much unlessthey marry near relatives.

What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do ,Organization  PANIX Public Access Unix  NYCLines  27 lots of pretty good stuff about how the huge towers near most nuclearpower plants are there to cool the used steam back into near ambienttemperature water deleted   water.  As I recall the water isnt as hot  thermodynamically  in many  fossil fuel plants  and of course there is less danger of radioactive  contamination.        Actually  fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling water reactor nuclear plants.   Theres a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology .  So its more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.      as a point of info  some of the early nuclear power plants in thiscountry used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot  andthen had a second stage  fossil fuel  step to get the water  actuallysteam  VERY HOT.

The tour of the Bible Ive taken in studying the passages he points to in the 3 02 text  has been most re warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears    which is not yet clear. Much much more important is  Charity     which by definition  is    	                   Love for GOD I hope Dear Reader  youve taken all this as an expression of faith   and not a statement of mere fact.

Calling a library which creates widgets  multiple times ,"Nntp Posting Host  bruno.cs.colorado.eduOrganization  University of Colorado  BoulderLines  91A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which setup an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize   shouldnever be called more than once.  This helped.  However  I am still havingsome problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely modelsmy real program.  In the actual program  I am writing a library  callablefrom any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function iscalled  it must initialize things  and after that  it should just use theold stuff  still around because of static variables .

Certainty and Arrogance,Organization  FNAL AD NetLines  110In article  Apr.17.01.11.29.1993.2278 geneva.rutgers.edu kilroy gboro.rowan.edu  Dr Nancys Sweetie  writes  Someone called  REXLEX has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop  but he did not bother to explain what it was  preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre  ramble about Wittgenstein  and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.I will answer this as I find time.   REXLEX suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_  by Francis Schaeffer.  I didnt think very highly of it  but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it  though  so dont let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion  Id suggest _On Certainty_  by Ludwig Wittgenstein.   Darren F Provine   kilroy gboro.rowan.edu  If any substantial number of    talk.religion.misc    readers read some  Wittgenstein  60  of the postings would disappear.   If they  understood   some Wittgenstein  98  would disappear.          Michael L Siemon Notice what I said about this book.  I called it  Easy reading.   The reason Idropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaicalSimons.  I dont know how many walking encyclopedias I ran across inphilosphy classes.  The problem isnt in knowing sooooo much more than youraverage lay person  the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he waswritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel wasto simple.  Ive talked with Schaeffer one on one.  Ive been in lectures withthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and profs from secularas well as Christian universities.  ND alone would fill both those catagories  His answers were enough that the profs themselves often were taken back andcaused to re think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again atdifferent open forums.  So yes  Schaeffers books are by in large  well simplistic.  It certainly isnt grad level reading.  But we must get off ourhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think mostpeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein   I may have more tosay about this secular scientist at another time.Also  one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by  insistent inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubtbase.  Look  the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we mustadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none inkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we knowits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaustit of all value THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic. It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism  and not Christianfaith  which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing  wefly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironiclesson of life   More without limits is less   less with limits is more.   Or as I have so often stated it  freedom without form soon becomes form w ofreedom.Lets put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed toabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell thedifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianitys contention withrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it  but that it has verylittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trustgo hand in hand  but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be calledto go on by itself without his understanding.This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if theChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God  it must suspend judgmentand say   Father I do not understand you but I trust you.   Now dont read allyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasnt saying I do not understandyou at all  but I trust you anyway.  It means that  I do not understand You  inthis situation  but I do understand  why I trust You  anyway   Therefore I cantrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mysteryunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter isa statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery ofFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It isnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always knowwhy  but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes allthe difference.Now  there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have partedcompany with philosophy  what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bitmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faithlike the insistent  whying  of a 3 year old.  It isnt just that we would liketo know what we do not know but that we feel we  must  know what we cannotknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied  the otherleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is incoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything aftercoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God  then we will always needto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to graspthat  we may not be able to trust him  for anything we do not understand maycount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  If  on the other hand  we do know why we trust God  we will be able to trusthim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing.  Too many Xianleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head whichallows for understanding at every foot fall   For what God is doing may beambiguous  but it will not be inherently contradictory   It may be mystery tous  but mystery is only inscrutable  what would be insufferable is absurdity.And that my friend  was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and inpractice.

It       is  in fact  so convenient that  were I capable of believing       in a god  I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.       The only difficulty left then  of course  is picking which sect       to join.  There are just so many.               Dean Kaflowitz        Yes  Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus    Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a    hateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So    convenient that it is burdensome at times.    Some Christians take a 10  discount off the Ten Commandments.  Sunday  cannot be substituted for the Sabbath.Make that 20 .

There is other hardware out  there not compromised.  DES as an example  triple DES as a better one.  What follows is my opinion. It is not asserted to be  the truth  so no flames  please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.No wonder American businesses are going down the tubes      Id be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business  if they told me it was more secure than DES  and in particular resistant to attempts by Japanese  French  and other competitive companies and governments to break. Its NIST  not NSA.  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this. They didnt say that.  They said is was better than some commercial gradeencryptions.  I  for one  wouldnt trust them if they did  unless theyrelease the algorithm for investigation. Id be happy to do so even with escrowed keys  provided I was happy about the bona fides of the escrow agencies  the Federal Reserve would certainly satisfy me  as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms .Maybe the ACLU and EFF.   It would have to be a non profit  so the big 8would be out.  Id trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors  Id be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.I wouldnt trust the NSA.  I think I would trust the President on this  butIm not certain he would be told. Id trust something from the NSA long before Id trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.Thats your problem. This may seem surprising to some here  but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way. Most many some  pick one  corporations have an attitude that the NSA is part of our government and  we support our government   as one very famous CEO put it to me one day.I want to emphasize the I am not speaking for Beckman Instruments at thispoint.

Of course I am trying to make plans of how to spend all this extra     money.  Right now I have an 89 accord  a good car  but not real sporty       I was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around      20k on a sports car of some kind.  After thinking about it  I may have a     better idea    Ill keep the Accord until it drops and buy the car Ive     always wanted    a Corvette Stingray. My reasoning is that  8000  accord        8000  corvette    16000 is less than what I would spend anyway.          Basically  Im thinking of a late 70s  early 80s for around  7  10k.     My question is  what are good years to consider  for reliability  looks      horsepower    in that order  believe it or not  horsepower is not a main     concern  if I want to go fast  I get on my motorcycle  and what are     good prices           Also  what would insurance look like   Im male  single  23  I might     wait until Im 25 to get the car   lower insurance . Would the fact that     I mainly drive the other car lower it   Is there some type of  classic     car  or  rarely driven  insurance class for driving it under 10k miles     per year              My dad has a 66 vette and its on what you say classic insurance.        Basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving        time  which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would        probably suit your needs for limited mileage.                In my area  Denver  if you look around alittle you can get an    1984 for 10 000 or less  not much less. You said your not looking    to go fast  they are a really nice car just not real powerful.  In addition to restricted mileage  many classic insurance carriers also require that the vehicle be garaged when not in use.   0.02  Ericy                                                                                 Eric Youngblood                                                       Bell Northern Research    _                                           Richardson  Texas 75082 _                                                                         _                                                                                                                                                   Peon w o Email privs

Rejetting carbs  ,Keywords  air pumpDistribution  naOrganization  Tektronix   Colorado Data Systems  Englewood  COLines  58In article  jburney.734756216 hydra.nodc.noaa.gov  jburney hydra.nodc.noaa.gov  Jeff Burney  writes   If we are only talking about 4 stroke  I think I can understand exhaust pulse affect in a 2 stroke   the intake valve is closed on the exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the cyclinder.  I guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the  canister.  Meaning  would gases  so far  down the line  the canister  really have an effect on the exhaust stroke   Do the gases really  compress that much     For discussion purposes  I will ignore dynamic effects like pulsesin the exhaust pipe  and try to paint a useful mental picture.1.  Unless an engine is supercharged  the pressure available to forceair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intakevalve is opened  the pressure differential available to move air is onlythe difference between the combustion chamber pressure  left over afterthe exhaust stroke  and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on theintake stroke  combustion chamber pressure is decreased  allowingatmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no timedoes the pressure ever become  negative   or even approach a goodvacuum.2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing  the pressure in thecombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system upto the first major flow restriction  the muffler .  Note that the volumeof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volumethat must flow through the intake  because of the temperaturedifference and the products of combustion.3.  In the last 6 8 years  the Japanese manufacturers have startedpaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning  in pursuit of almightyhorsepower.  At this point in time  on high performance bikes substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almostzero affect on performance  because the stock intake system flows verywell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will makevery little difference  unless  in general  the new exhaust system is_much_ louder than the stocker.4.  On older bikes   exhaust back pressure was the dominating factor.If free flowing air filters were substituted  very little differencewas noted  unless a free flowing exhaust system was installed as well.5.  In general  an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At anygiven RPM  anything that will cause the engine to pump more air  be iton the intake or exhaust side  will cause it to produce more horsepower.Pumping more air will require recalibration  rejetting  of the carburetor.

One  slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know  he is allergic to bee stings  but that his reaction is severe localized  swelling  not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that   however  because thats not written in their little rule book. Of course  bee venom isnt a single chemical.  Could be your brother is reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock in other people.Hmmm.  The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reactionthe first posters brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if Ishould worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times its normalsize.   And itched     Ow    He basically said I shouldnt this time  butthat bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and thatnext time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly thiswas many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I dontget stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me  but I dont.  This isnt scientific or proof  but this would lead me to believe its not adifferent reaction  just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies workthat way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes  somepeople can get by with just monitoring their diet  others have to monitortheir diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their dietlike a hawk and use insulin regularly.  I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions toit.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and cant use soysauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesntnecessarily mean that its safe for everyone.

If they would of  had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the  compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.                                     Initial assault on the  compound    more like a wooden farm house if  it burned to the ground like it did   for WHAT   Regardless of who  started caused the fire  NONE of this would have happened if the  ATF can HONESTLY justify their initial assault and handled it   properly      QUESTION AUTHORITY    SNIP   With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed  more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is  the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Look  at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country  of ours.    With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with    Show me some evidenence instead of repeating what the FBI ATF  told you.  mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few  women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn  to death 51 days later.    Then Im sure you wont mind if the ATF or the DEA raid your house  someday on a bogus informant tip.  So what if they killed wounded your   family  accidentally  during the raid  its just a fair price to pay  for law and order in this country  right   Answer this question   honestly before making anymore ignorant statements     What is even more disturbing than out of control government agencies  are citizens who allow them to be irresponsible.

Colormaps with dialog shells,Organization  MIT Media LaboratoryLines  17I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created withXCreateColormap   and uses all of the colors available for my 8 bitdisplay.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the  TechnicolorEffect    which is fine.  Basically  my program works.My problem question is  When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user forsome input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set toXmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor isover the dialogShell I get my colormap  but if the cursor is over theapplicationShell  or any window other than the dialogShell  I get thedefault colormap.  But Id like it so that if my cursor is over _any_window of my application  I get my colormap.Any suggestions   Thanks david 
Help   Which bikes are short ,Organization  Climate and Global Dynamics Division NCAR  Boulder  COLines  18Help   Ive got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle.  This is great Unfortunately  she needs at most a 28  seat.  This is not great.  So far the only thing weve found was an old and unhappy looking KZ440.So  its time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there.Anybody know of models  old models and used bikes are not a problem with a 28  or lower seat   And  since she has to make this difficult   8     she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser.

I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading   this group  from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5   different groups out of this is a wate  and will only result in a few posts   a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum   for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way    Just curious.   Daemon What he said...    Ditto here too...

Defensemen  21 45 ,"Organization  Computer Science Department  Stanford University.Lines  85 21	PETER AHOLA		Season  2ndAcquired 	92 93  trade with Pittsburgh for future considerationsGrade 		I  B It is way too early to tell about Ahola  who was acquired probably because thePenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola hadonly played 50 games this season  I think its actually less  the San JoseMercury News may be in err here   20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games hehas played  he appeared quite solid defensively  although he hasnt beenspectacular  and his offense isnt anything to write home about  8 points  its even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turnout to be ... Peter Ahola. 24	DOUG WILSON		Season  16thAcquired 	91 92  trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and		2nd round pick in 92 entry draftGrade 		I  B I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson  I may have had too highexpectations for him  but his legs  knees  et al.  are giving out.Nevertheless  when he was playing  he exhibited a strong shooting andplaymaking abilities  even if he has lost a step on defense  which unfortunately  he demonstrated this year as well  as at times he was slow tocatch the opponent forwards  and his offensive output was only good enough for2nd place on the team  20 points in 42 games .  But next year  which may beWilsons last  if he can stay healthy  he can still be a contributor. 29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season 	2ndAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		I  C  D  Its probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful ofgames  forgetting exact number  but no more than 15   but at age 25 hesquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games he did not impress anyone  after generating 7 shots in the first period ofthe first game he played  he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here withthe Sharks  and was even less impressive defensively  as he appeared awkwardwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap inhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team. 38	PAT MACLEOD		Season  2ndAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		I    MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad  but it appears to mymemory that he played less than Kolstad  because the Sharks were reluctant touse him  but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors  figuring thathe wouldnt clear waivers  in fact  he has played the past 4 5 weeks withKansas City  but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a  rehab assignment  that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.Since he has played so little  I cant even give a tentative grade on him  buthe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensiveskills. 41	TOM PEDERSON		Season  1stAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		I  B  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimatedby injuries  Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net  including yourstruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills  scoring 20 points in43 games.  However  his size  5 9   165 lbs.  is of concern  and soon afterhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice  although he had appeared fearless in his approach.But to be successful  he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chanceon surviving against some of the bigger players in the league. 45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season  1stAcquired 	91 92  from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade 		I  D  D He played all of  5 games in the league this year  but was thoroughlyumimpressive  just as he was at the end of last season  again  it may be asmall sample  but just as in the case of Kolstad  Scremin  at age 25  isquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense ordefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing thatwill go down in Scremins entry of league stats is probably the fact that hewas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.

More Diamond SS 24X,Organization  Michigan State UniversityLines  30NNTP Posting Host  horus.cem.msu.edu  Has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this  card. Is only in Windows. I have replaced card and am waiting on   latest drivers. Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors  in WSPDPSF.DRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup.  I had a ATI Ultra but was getting Genral Protection Fault errors  in an SPSS application. These card manufactures must have terrible  quality control to let products on the market with so many bugs.  What a hassle. Running on Gateway 2000 DX2 50.  Thx Dave L     Youre using drivers version 2.02 or earlier. The latest is 2.03  availablefrom their BBS or by snailmail. It at least fixes the WfW problem.The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is becauseof following  I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was toldthat I can expect a new version near the end of the month. Which should beabout now...However  I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standardmode. Apparently they dont know of this problem and seem to be surprisedwhy anybody would want to use standard mode at all.Its a great card for the price  at least when I bought it. Now there may bebetter alternatives.Bo Peng

Clinton press conference  part 2,Organization  R node Public Access Unix   1 416 249 5366Lines  99Here is a press release from the White House. President Clintons Remarks On Waco With Q A To  National Desk Contact  White House Office of the Press Secretary  202 456 2100   WASHINGTON  April 20  U.S. Newswire     Following areremarks by President Clinton in a question and answer sessionwith the press  Part 2 of 2       Go ahead  Sarah.     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  Thefirst is  I think that they knew very well that the children did nothave gas masks while the adults did  so the children had no chancebecause this gas was very    she said it was not lethal  but it wasvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survivedwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th    lets go back    didntthose people have a right to practice their religion      THE PRESIDENT   They were not just practicing theirreligion  they were    the Treasury Department believed that they hadviolated federal laws  any number of them.     Q  What federal laws        THE PRESIDENT   Let me go back and answer    I cantanswer the question about the gas masks  except to tell you that thewhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested  theywere convinced that it wouldnt kill either a child or an adult butit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one ofthe things that Ive heard    I dont want to get into the details ofthis because I dont know    but one of the things that they werespeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast thatthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might haveescaped and that may be why it didnt have the desired effect.     They also knew  Sarah  that there was an undergroundcompound    a bus buried underground where the children could besent.  And they were    I think they were hoping very much that ifthe children were not released immediately outside that the humanething would be done and that the children would be sent someplacewhere they could be protected.     In terms of the gas masks themselves  I learnedyesterday    I did not ask this fact question before    that the gaswas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masksthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if theyall had gas masks  that eventually the gas would force them out in anonviolent  nonshooting circumstance.     MS. MYERS   Last question.     Q  Mr. President  why are you still saying that        Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever askedJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide   And when youlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through yourmind during those horrendous moments      THE PRESIDENT   What I asked Janet Reno is if they hadconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said   and  of course  the whole issue of suicide had been raised in thepublic    he had    that had been debated anyway.  And she said thatthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issuesconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there wouldbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime inthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they wereright or wrong  of course  we will never know.     What happened when I saw the fire  when I saw thebuilding burning   I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediateconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they wereescaping or whether they were inside  trying to burn themselves up.Thats the first thing I wanted to know.     Thank you.     Q  Mr. President  why are you still saying it was aJanet Reno decision   Isnt it  in the end  your decision      THE PRESIDENT   Well  what Im saying is that I didnthave a four  or five hour  detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didntgo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which Itake responsibility.  Im the President of the United States and Isigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority tomake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday  some time hadelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow  I will support you.And I do support her.     She is not ultimately responsible to the Americanpeople  I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in anappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think aswell as she could have.     Thank you.   Applause.   30

MGBs and the real world,Article I.D.  cactus.1993Apr6.035544.16865Organization  Capital Area Central Texas UNIX Society  Austin  TxLines  24In article  1993Apr5.181056.29411 mks.com  mike mks.com  Mike Brookbank  writes  My sister has an MGB.  She has one from the last year they were produced  1978  1979  .  Its in very good shape.  Ive been bugging her for years about selling it.  Ive said over and over that she should sell it before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability. Grass Roots Motorsport  3 93  has a long article about MG Bs this month.As far as collectivity speculation is concerned they think it is a waste of time  especially the later rubber bumpered models are the leastdesirable  a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its lowvalue are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very goodcar.Craig Which one of us is right   Are there MGB affectionados out there who are still willing to pay  6K to 8K for an old MG   Are there a lot out in the  market                                                                                     Mike Brookbank                   MKS  35 King St. North       mike mks.com  Director  InterOpen Sales        MKT  Waterloo  Ontario       519 884 2251  Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

Another key registration body bites the dust  IMHO ,Organization  Yale CS Mail News GatewayLines  46One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registrationbody is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU isessentially a group of auditors  they audit how peoples civilliberties are administered.  Traditionally  auditors do not like to getinvolved in the design or operational aspects of things  and with goodreason.When I was a systems programmer  it always infuriated me that theauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from asecurity point of view  but wouldnt tell us how to fix it.  I alwaysfigured they just liked to critcize  without doing the work to help fixthe problem.Then I took a stint as an auditor  and I found out the real reason.Auditors dont like to recommend solutions  because it puts them in abad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  Theauditee can say   Well  you told us this way would be OK.   Itcompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditorsjob.Taking the case at hand  suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.Suppose that  perhaps through some error on ACLUs part  a key half getsaway that shouldnt  and is used to deprive someone of her civilliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this  and wants to take it to court.But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendantand of the plaintiff  which is not an easy position to be in.There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors  at oneplace where I worked  when payroll checks were printed  they were signedautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drumwas kept by the auditors  who also kept the check stock   andwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.I believe the difference between this situation and the key registrationsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payrollchecks   if they were done yesterday  and someone wants to do them againtoday  he better be able to produce yesterdays checks so that they canbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves arelegit is a trickier process  one much more prone to mistakes that couldput the ACLU in a protecting the client versus protecting the ACLUconflict of interest.As always  my opinions are my own.Lynn GrantGrant Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL
 new  reason for Clipper algm secrecy,Organization  AT T Bell LaboratoriesLines  31In article  1993Apr20.155924.29995 news.clarkson.edu   tuinstra signal.ece.clarkson.edu.soe  Dwight Tuinstra  writes   First  note that the  experts  will only look at  details   and of just   the algorithm         In addition  respected experts from outside the      government will be offered access to the confidential details of      the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report      their findings.    Why not the chip design   Well  heres the possiblity   in addition to  encryption  the chip pre processes voice signals to make them easier  to analyze transcribe electronically.  The chip  once widespread  might  effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for  voice   grepping  the US phone network  or the criminal   wrong thinking patrons  thereof .First of all  the chip doesnt do that.  It runs at 16 megabits second which is far beyond what you need for voice.  Its obviously intendedfor data as well  and on high speed lines at that.Second    what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone I dont care how fancy that chip is  its not as fancy as the roomfulof analyzers at Fort Meade running the program theyll have 5 years fromnow.  They cant update every Clipper chip thats out there.Third    if they did do this preprocessing in the chip  it would probablyhave a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  Ifnothing else  that would hurt the acceptability of the product.  TheV.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly massaged voice as is  add any more to the mix  and youre completely outof the ballpark.

Blues into playoffs  beat TB 6 5,Keywords  Blues  Shanahan  Joseph  Hull  Minnesota  TBNntp Posting Host  cec1Organization  Washington University  St. Louis MOLines  127By Dave Luecking Of The Post Dispatch StaffAt 9 11 Thursday night  the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.Their cheer quickly turned into a roar  and finally  the sellout crowd of17 816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute tothe playoff bound Blues.The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit    Red Wings 5  Stars 3.With the North Stars loss  the Blues officially clinched fourth place and thefinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing  because the Blues quitplaying.They held a 5 1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit Minnesota final appearedwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleepand barely held on for a 6 5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.Tampas Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers  but officiatingsupervisor John DAmico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that theshot had gone into the net after time had expired.  Im glad I didnt see it go in at the end   Blues coach Bob Berry said.If the goal had counted  hed have been more upset than he was by the Bluesdisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and makingthe playoffs tempered Berrys anger.  It wasnt pretty at the end   he said.   We played 36  37 great minutes  asgood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldnt have  butit did. Still  the Blues won  prompting another ovation from the crowd at games end.Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil thisseason  the Blues still made the playoffs. Theyll meet the Chicago Blackhawksin a best of seven Norris Division semifinal  beginning at noon Sunday atChicago Stadium.The Blues finished the regular season with a record of 37 36 11 for 85 points their fourth consecutive plus .500 season. Minnesota finished three pointsbehind in fifth place  with a record of 36 38  10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2 2 at Tampa  ended itsfirst season with a record of 23 54 7 for 53 points.The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyousBlues locker room. Instead  the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  Its a shame we let down   said Kevin Miller  one of three Blues to scoretwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.  There was no need for a letdown. If wed have kept working  it would haveended 6 2 and everyone would be happy. Instead  a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.  We won  and thats all that matters   said Brett Hull  scoreless and minus 3for the night.   Once we got up 4 0  it was really tough to play. Some players didnt have a problem.  Just because the score was announced  our line didnt quit   said RichSutter  who played with Bassen and Miller.   We still had a game to play. Youcant allow five goals like we did  thats not right.  It was disappointing to see what was going on. Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues effort. Somehow he missed the announcement of Minnesotas loss.  I didnt know it was final   he said.   I was kind of looking around on thebench. I didnt realize it was a final for some reason. Were in the playoffs and thats great  but its a little disappointing to play like we did at theend. The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboardoperators to keep the Minnesota Detroit score off of the board. The scoreshowed 0 0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4 2 in the thirdperiod. The Blues already led 4 0 at the time.  I told them I didnt want to see the score  I didnt want to know the score  Berry said.   I felt we had to win the game  and thats the approach we took. If Minnesota took a lead  Berry feared  the pressure of having to win mightbother the Blues. If Detroit led  he worried  the Blues might quit.Until the announcement  the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowdgoing at 10 44 of the first period  scoring his 50th of the season. Then Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.With the teams playing four on four  Miller broke in on left wing  dekeddefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with therebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.Then  just 10.5 seconds later  Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonskiafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.Bassen made it 4 0 just 14 seconds into the second period  scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedicans shot. The goal gave him his first two goal game ofthe season and reminded him of a special friend.Last year  Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill  who died of a rare formof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  I was thinking of my buddy Oliver   Bassen said.   Hes in heaven now  andI know he was watching. I know hes happy. Miller increased the Blues lead to 5 0 on a break away goal set up by Zomboat 11 09. Then  Steve Maltais broke Curtis Josephs shutout just 18 secondslater  making it 5 1.Less than a minute after the North Stars final was announced  Tim Berglandscored and cut the lead to 5 2. But Shanahan scored his 51st  converting a passfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.Then  it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the thirdperiod  prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goalsto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1 21 midway through the thirdperiod.The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahans second goal stand up as thewinner.   We were in there   Shanahan said.   The game was over. We were in.                                                                                 __  ______________         ____________________________________               _ ____________          A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S                         __________                                                                  ________                                                                  _______                   Joe Ashkar                                                                 Contact for the Blues                               SAINT LOUIS           jca2 cec1.wustl.edu                             ___              BLUES

Actually  what I think has become more evident  is that you are determined to   flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than   Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of   hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty   plus minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.    Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice   time per game and some measure of its  quality   i.e.  is the player put out   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game  is he matched up   against the other teams top one or two lines  short handed  etc   I would   much rather see the     disappear altogether instead of having its dubious   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.    is a useful statistic.  If a player is on the ice when his team scores alot of goals and only allows a few goals  he must be doing something right.It is especially useful to compare between teammates  as they play for thesame team and should have roughly similar     ratings if they are equallygood players.  It can be adjusted  with varying degrees of success to comparebetween players on different teams.I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics  but how usefulare the ones that you suggest    Total ice time would be very useful  it isa missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuringthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be abetter stat for evaluating coaching  ie are the players given quality icetime actually their talented ones   A very good player could be given lowamounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach whodoesnt recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots ofquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach thatthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than    and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.    is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to seethat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowedis a very positive thing  and should be evaluated as such.Gregmeister

Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed  as was clearly shown    by the Graphite and  9GXEs  cheating .  Cant they just admit that    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and or cheat on   WinTach    is much harder to beat...2.  The big  cheat  that Hercules IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and    PolyLine optimization  and Hercules sent them a new driver which didnt    do this    but produced almost identical scores.  Yet  the only thing    PC Magazine says is that scores are not  legitimate     couldnt they    at least make some comment about its real world performance Im not so much going by WinBench for performance  but  rather  by SteveGibsons results  which are more real world based  like using MicrografxDraw to benchmark .  If you believe Gibson  that is ...     He writes      Despite these documented cheats  I have to say that in real world     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than     any other display adapter in the industry.    ...   Even though its     just a modest ISA bus card  it outperformed every local bus adapter I     have  including the Stealth 24 VLB  the Fahrenheit 1280VA VLB  the     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000 based Diamond Viper VLB.

How can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps Akgun Living through those days at the age of 20 and followingthe internal and external news gives me that knowledgeand position.  In 1974  Turkey had a democratic goverment and freepress at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies  I haventheard anything from any international source about anyconcentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey.However  I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well recognized POW camp.    As for all the registered prisoners to the Red Cross having returned to  their homes  this is your version of the story.  There are cases in which prisoners who were registered  some of them even sent messages to their  relatives  were not released.  These are undeniable facts. I see   They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks havedecided to acknowledge their existence first but laterchanged their minds releasing them.  Is that it   What doyou think happened to them   I thought that MIAs are only the subject of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.  As for their treatment being according to what convention...  Okay we believe you.You dont need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine statein its history   It has been a respected and continuous member of UN since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership ofTurkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer itbefore wasting anytime.  Yes   UN had a few condemning resolutions against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem  especially afterthe 1980 coup.  Well  US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960 74  Greeks hadtheir own share too.  closed matter today between Turkish Cypriots Turks Greeks Greek   Cypriots.  There is no more any official demand from Greek  Cypriots about any missing Greek Cypriots.  Where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons  Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talksmediated by Gali   There was no issue whatsoever about anymissing people among the negotiating parties.  was there I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish andInternational press.  He keeps saying that  This was nolonger an issue for peace talks.   Also  you dont wantme fish for the Greek Cypriot politicians words  that Argichad posted zillion times  describing missing peoples as a Greek Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions among Greek Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish custody. ..  Your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup deta and the invasion  5 days  is simply not true.  All the cases of missing persons I know  and I know quite a few  are cases of people who were  either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield  or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish army. I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what wasgiven to Greek Cypriots as an answer by TurkishGoverment Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate someof their own between July 15 and the final cease fire inlate August  1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international community  the UN  and the Vasilu Goverment  since he did not make itan issue for the peace talks .  Also  I am not aware of any UNcondemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek Cypriot.  Are you   BTW  do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup detaand nobody got hurt in those events     As of the few photos which you refer to  there are more than a few. There are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being  rounded up   but also others in the prison camp in Turkey.Like I said before.  There is even a different opinion amongGreek Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army whogoverned the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudesto cover up their tracks 8  .  I hope Turkish Army doest have same type of morons for the security of Turkiye.  However  this must a good subject for a movie script.  One should inform Oliver Stone     about this.    Of course  not.  The justice was served well.  If and when the Bosnian   pleas are answered  whos going to dare to ask what happens to those   masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea.  They are known today    as EOKA B masterminds were known in 1974  to everybody and are doing   it openly even giving TV interviews.  It may take same time as it was   for the EOKA B case  however  the justice will be served again.  Akgun  comparing the actions of the Serbians in Bosnian with the                                                                   actions of            Turkey in Cyprus is not something I would do if I were a Turk.                                                               I thought that the Serbians were the savages  the inhumane beasts etc etc.   C.

Thats a little over 200 years as I  recall.  Id say that for the most part it was religious persecution   their religion dictated their lifestyle .  This is a stretch.

The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games.The Sound Driver is pretty ok  since its fast. Sound Manager used by thebook is  useless . Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completedis out of the question for games with smooth animation.  Its too slow. The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately System 7 supports it poorly  making programs crash occasionally. The more of the story is to developers  DONT CHEAT  Really  I am absolutely  positively not allowed to do what I am about to do  but Im going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound  Really soon  you will be sorry  as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now  and works pretty well and will work even better soon  so use it.Well  I want my code to work on old systems too. I dont know about sys 7.1 but at least on 6.0.7  there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causeschannels to hang  with no error message . This happends when I keep achannel open for long periods   necessary for performance   and play manysounds  stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is toinspect private variables in the channel  QHead  I think it was   and theonly way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented  flag and modify it.Am I happy with this  Nope.

Do you know of any human  cultures that have this type of mythology  For example  where one might  eat a food as representative of the body of a god  thus ritualized  cannibalism in the absence of the original.  I know of ritual cannibalism among tribes in Papua Neuguinea    . They used to eat the brain of killed opponents. Sometimes these brains contained infectious agents which lead to a disease called  Kuru . Since cannibalism was banished by the government  the number of Kuru cases has dropped sharply. Oh  yeah   Well    I  know of ....Anyways  cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesnt do it isPROOF positive that we are more advanced  would have us believe.  Cannibalismis often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved onealive.  Many other cultures  including many American Indian cultures  eat atethe flesh of slain enemies  often as a way of showing respect for the valor ofthe departed.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary  the Saturn V blueprints    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on    microfilm.    The problem in re creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings  it    is finding vendors who can supply mid 1960s vintage hardware  like    guidance system components   and the fact that the launch pads and VAB    have been converted to Space Shuttle use  so you have no place to launch    from.    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re modify    the launch pads  you may as well have started from scratch with a clean    sheet design.    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISNT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     scooped  by people uninvolved in the mission. However  NASA frequently    releases examples  in non digital form  e.g. photos  to the public early    in a mission.    RISKS OF NUCLEAR  RTG  POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in    worst case scenarios  shuttle explosion during launch  or accidental    reentry at interplanetary velocities   the risks are extremely small.    Two interesting data points are  1  The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2    RTGs  which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months    with no release of plutonium.  2  In April 1970  the Apollo 13 lunar    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source  which    was jettisoned  fell intact into the 20 000 feet deep Tonga Trench in    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10    half lives of the Pu 238 fuel or about 870 years  DOE 1980 .

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER    From time to time  claims are made that chemicals released from    the Space Shuttles Solid Rocket Boosters  SRBs  are responsible    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact  both in    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted    study  Charles Jackman.    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups  and was    organized by Dr. Michael Prather  NASA Goddard Institute for Space    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     NASA GISS   Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass  NASA Goddard Space    Flight Center   and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze  Atmospheric and    Environmental Research  Inc. .  The effort was to look at the effects    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine        Industrial sources     300 000 000 kilograms year	  Natural sources      75 000 000 kilograms year	  Shuttle sources 	  725 000 kilograms year    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25  to the    total stratospheric chlorine sources.    The effect on ozone is minimal   global yearly average total ozone would    be decreased by 0.0065 . This is much less than total ozone variability    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.    The influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1  decrease in globally    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons    do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE    If you  dont  try to hold your breath  exposure to space for half a    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your    breath is likely to damage your lungs  something scuba divers have to    watch out for when ascending  and youll have eardrum trouble if your    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up  but theory predicts    and animal    experiments confirm    that otherwise  exposure to vacuum causes no    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.    Various minor problems  sunburn  possibly  the bends   certainly some     mild  reversible  painless  swelling of skin and underlying tissue     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes     youre dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn  eds  Report SAM TR 65 48  June 1965   USAF School    of Aerospace Medicine  Brooks AFB  Texas.    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is    a well documented fact  see the Rogers Commission report  for example.    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the    astronauts  never mind destroy their bodies  according to the Kerwin    teams medical forensic report.    The astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the    water at circa 200MPH  and their bodies then spent several weeks    underwater. Their remains were recovered  and after the Kerwin team    examined them  they were sent off to be buried.    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT    You cant use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit    because it cant get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry    enough fuel  even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.    Furthermore  it is not particularly sensible to do so  because much of    that weight is things like wings  which are totally useless except in    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly    specialized for travel between Earths surface and low orbit. Taking it    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit    spacecraft.     Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.     THE  FACE ON MARS     There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery     35A72  much more facelike in appearance  and the one more often    published  with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon  and 70A13     with the Sun 27 degrees from the west .    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is    artificial  intended to resemble a human  and erected by an    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a    smiley faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society  sorry  dont    know the address  to study the Face.    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high resolution    camera  and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this    question in a few years. In the meantime  speculation about the Face is    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors  not sci.space or    sci.astro.    V. DiPeitro and G.

Im considering writing the be all and end all of solutions  that launches the MD5  and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net  and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it cant get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes  use the MD5. This way I could have guaranteed good bits  and a deterministic upper bound on login time  and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds. 53 seconds to hash 20M of core  I bet I know who the source of yourinformation is  . No  its not acceptable if its part of your loginprocess. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source ofpseudo random information  do the right thing and pass it through acryptographic hash function  not a compressor. Aside from the factthat it will run faster  it will give better results  think of acryptographic hash as a function that  distills  randomness .Something along the lines of 	etherfind  t  x  n    dd bs 1k count 10 2  dev null   md5should do the trick.  t gives you timestamps  and the lack of  u makessure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K.

DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME,Organization  Bellcore  Livingston  NJLines  128In article  1993Apr15.093231.5148 news.yale.edu     Steve Tomassi  writes            Hi  baseball fans  So what do you say  Dont you think he deserves it    I       mean  heck  if Dave Winfield  ho hum  is seriously being considered for it    as      is Lee Smith  ha   then why dont we give Dave Kingman a chance  Or Darrell      Evans  Yeah  yeah  After the Hall of Fame takes in them  it can take in   Eddie      Murray and Jeff Reardon.I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feelingor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.However  I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of thepeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. Ifeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve togo but that they would deserve it more. IMHO Dave Kingman   definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were hecould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do notthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for thegame. I mean really I am a Met fan   he was a Met for part of his career and Istill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.Dave Winfield   I think so. He is feared by pitchers  he has had severalseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion   without stats  better than Kingmans  probably by quite abit . I also perceive him to be a leader  maybe not as much as some otherpeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantialcontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this aresome of the charitable things he has done  I know some of this from when hewas with the Yankees . I think he the type of player that kids can look up toand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame Ithink it deserves some consideration.Lee Smith   Maybe  I would have to see his stats again but he definately woulddeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.Darrell Evans   No.Eddie Murray   Maybe  He has had a very good career  he is a leader  althougha silent one   he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough  I am notsure   but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingmans boththe average as well as the power numbers  but not as good as Winfields . Justthink  Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.Jeff Reardon   My guess is no  but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off thetop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.           Well  in any case  I am sick and tired  mostly sick  of everybody   giving      Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards    marginal.      Honestly  Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there. Theyre both      shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.   Well  I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. Italked about leadership above  both of these guys are leaders and have beeninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have verygood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbersoffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run forevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop   he would haveshattered Aarons home run mark by now. How many of those great plays savedgames  How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win agame  While I believe both of these guys have numbers  baseball is about morethan numbers  or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers .Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As doesGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.        Lets be a little more selective  huh  Stop handing out these honors   so      liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it  if   something      isnt done  there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When      certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential      candidates  the absurdity is apparent. Gee  can these guys even compare to      the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan    Steve Garvey   I am not sure  probably not but I guess I could see someonemaking a case for him. Jack Morris   Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone mightbring up his name.Kirby Puckett   Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he stillhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then myprobably will turn into a definately.Nolan Ryan   Is there really any doubt  I think I heard something about himhaving some 53 records  maybe they were not all good   I dont know I did nothear any of them just the number . He has the numbers  he has thecontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I wouldnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game  probably not eventop 20  but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Famebecause of his accomplishments  no hitters  strikeouts  respectable numbers  even with some weaker teams  you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALLthe possible votes.So in summing up I have 3 groups  those that belong  those that probably dobut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying dont belong at leastnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.Yes    Winfield  Yount  Brett not in your mail   O. Smith  Puckett and RyanMaybe   Murray and L. SmithNo   Reardon  Garvey  Morris  Evans and definately KingmanAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back thisup   these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.Mike                                       Q Steve
Hard drive security ,Nntp Posting Host  servo.qualcomm.comReply To  karn chicago.qualcomm.comOrganization  Qualcomm  IncLines  37In article  C5K1CE.51A sunfish.usd.edu   vkub charlie.usd.edu  Vince Kub  writes    Now    the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if   certain threatening conditions are met. Once the key is gone there is no   question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell  the key is no   longer there to be produced.Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically ona communications link  as opposed to storage where the keys have to beretained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve thedata.The right way to do communications security is to generate a randomsession key with Diffie Hellman  use it for a while and then destroyit. Once its gone  theres no getting it back  and no way to decryptrecordings of the conversation.To make sure you arent being attacked by a man in the middle  youhave to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT T secure phone doesthis by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally overthe phone. This is nice and simple  but it relies on user awarenessplus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the usersvoices.A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since youdnever use RSA for actual encryption  compromising your RSA secret keywould only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would stillnot be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which thesession keys have been destroyed.Im convinced that this is how the governments own secure phones the STU III  must work.

Stephenson  writes...    2  Astros relief corps holding together.  If Doug Jones keeps his changeup       effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective  then its passable.       Theres no reasonable left handed help  and the middle relief is iffy.       Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role  but       hes been injured  and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway.         Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money  so they let him       go.  Doug Jones can lose his touch   he went from Clevelands all star       closer to the minors in a pretty short span.    From what I understand  Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the                                             club.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houstons success.  He must have another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West. No argument at all with Murphy.  He scared the hell out of me when he came inlast year.  On the other hand  the club though enough of Boever to put him intoan awful lot of games  he may have led the league in appearances   he did atleast at some point .  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy   but I guessthats not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two yearsago so well  though......       The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the       club so far.  Biggio and Finley just arent doing their job of getting       on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man  Bagwell has had to       assume Biggio and Finleys job.  Biggio concerns me  since he usually       starts the season very strong.Im not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over theyears and they have no good reasons to decline  no injuries  not old  ... .I expect them to come through just fine.  Its those guys that have notbeen consistently good that are the worrisome part  even if they are comingthrough right now.                                                   On a side note  are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next years uniform   There is talk that their road uniform will be  blech..  traditional grey  with the word  HOUSTON  written across the chest.  If Im not mistaken  their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange  shiver.. .  McLanes favorite color is red  so...This sounds like their old road unis.  Pretty dull.  Buttons or pullovers Ill check through my uniform book to see if theyve always had some orange.      Im really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound horrible.  Id like to see the uniform of the mid 1980s return.  They may not have been pretty  but Houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball    and I liked it.Well  well see.  Ive got a Astros pullover shirt with the  Astros stripes across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public.  ican see why they might want that to change.

1 and suicide for refutation,Lines  85Organization  University of Tennessee Division of Continuing EducationDistribution  usaIn article  1qmuv8INNl8s dns1.NMSU.Edu  loki acca.nmsu.edu  Entropic Destroyer  writes  The following is quoted from the tail end of a  rather condescending  article about Paxton Quigley  that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies   sorry... i think it was in the wall street journal...  and was repeated in the Colorado  peoples  Daily  a student newspaper at the University of Colorado at Boulder.   A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County  Wash.  found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner                                                                spouse  a friend  or child than to kill an intruder.         The  used to kill  is the heart of the misinformation.  Its oneof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of  Im sure  is that when peopleread this they think violent arguments where one member of the familygrabs a gun and shoots another  thereby creating a tragic situationwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there  ora tragic accident  especially involving a child.       Unfortunately  thats not the way things stack up.  The majorityof that 43  times   37 I believe  are suicides.  That is  someone intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill themselves.  And why its popular to try and blame suicides on guns the evidence doesnt support this.  Internal studies  as well ascomparative studies with other countries  indicate that culturalfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. Japan  for instance  has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  Therepeople jump off buildings.        According to the National Crime Survey  40  of violent crimeis commited by  non strangers   which mistakenly has been generalizedregarding the King County study to mean   Friends and family.   Thatis  Mr. Quigley  and others who quote this statistic  are banking onthe mental image that a  Friend  family member  or child   equatesto a loving relationship  and that it was cut short in a moment ofanger.  Unfortunately  all too often husbands beat and kill wives children assault parents  or vice versa.  Most rapes are commited by someone known to the victim  for instance.  Essentially  that a gunwas used against a  friend  or family member doesnt mean theywerent trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest amongpoor urban families  and those are also the areas most  at risk for family problems  especially violent ones.  A son in a gang maynot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburbankid might.       Finally  it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is theonly value of a self defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures Iworked out using the NCS I got about an 80 1 ratio between deadlyself defenses  justifiable homicides  and with gun self defenses.Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS theres an enormousamount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only validmeans of determining the success of such a defense  since accordingto the NCS  which has been considered by many to seriously under reportdefenses  there were far more successful with gun defenses than intruderskilled.       Not it also confines itself to the home  where attack by a  friendor family member  is far  far more likely  and excludes any defensewhich occurs outside the home.   I believe a large number occur inbusinesses.  Studies by the  Western Psychiatric Institute  in Pittsburgh  found that the mere presence of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member will commit suicide  even in the absence of psychiatric illness.        I have not seen the exact data for this  so I cant comment.  Iwill point out Canadas and Japans suicide rate as indications thatculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.       There was also a comparative study between Canada  for whatits worth  considering the difficulty of comparing across culturallines  published in the New England Journal of Medicine  I can get theexact cite if you need it  that concluded that restrictive firearm laws would not significantly impact the over all suicide rate.

Trying to cloud the issuewith comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaninglessbecause its like comparing apples to oranges  i.e.  people cantcontrol their race but they can control their behavior .What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue Nobody  including BSA  is denying anybody the right to live and orworship as they please or dont please   but it doesnt mean that BSAis the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized  positive  religiousand moral standards on which our society has been established and onwhich it should continue to be based.

This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions but in regards to  conventional  medicine.

I think all  of us cycle.  Ones success depends on how large the fluctuations  in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.  Unfortunately   Im not one of them.     This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat  which appears to be totally limitless  and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight. When I get too fat  I just diet exercise more  with varying degrees of success  to take off the extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range  but smaller and larger cycles occur as well. Im always afraid that this method will stop working someday  but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting  that results in long term weight gain . I have been cycle  dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.As mentioned in Adiposity 101  only some experience weightrebound.

Dont  repair  that sticky mouse button  CALL APPLE   ,Organization  UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS   AMHERSTLines  52Distribution  worldNNTP Posting Host  deimos.ucs.umass.eduX News Reader  VMS NEWS 1.24       X posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers        Youve heard about Apples great new customer  support  program.  Well think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Applecomputer users can give to each other.  For another example  read on In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_  Ric Ford described a two year effortby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apples attention a problem withcertain defective mice.  At random  the switches on these mice  stick  inthe down position until clicked a second time  apparently regardless of themachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of thereported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID ofBCGA65431. Youll recognize this  sticky button  symptom immediately if youhave such a mouse  the problem is intermittent  but its not subtle.Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem  and instead suggested that people contact Apples Customer Assistance Center directly _MacWeek_ 4 5 93 p. 64 . When I called Apple on March 23rd and describedmy defective mouse  I was eventually given a case number  F83Y  and toldApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out ofwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks  I called back today wonderingwhere my new mouse was. This time  I was told that Apple had decided theserial number on my mouse  MB13831FC25  is not within the  undisclosed range Apple is willing to replace  and there is nothing I can do about it.Nothing  that is  unless enough people complain about this problem to makeit worth Apples while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.Please  if you have one of these mice  I NEED YOUR HELP  Dont assume youknow what causes the problem  there are _lots_ of theories  and starthacking around inside your hundred dollar mouse. Instead  let Apple do it.Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at                   United States      1 800 776 2333                  Canada             800 665 2775                  UK and Europe      33 1 49 01 49 01                  Australia          61 2 452 8000                  Japan and Pacific  81 3 5411 8500If the number isnt toll free  call collect.  Describe the problem and askfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse  insist that they registerthe details of your case  including your mouses serial number.  Be firm.Network managers and user group leaders especially  please query your userbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please dont send mail tome or post yet another  sticky button  report  CALL APPLE DIRECTLY   Ifenough victims take the trouble to report this well known problem  Applewill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easyto stone wall on this issue  dont expect them to offer support when thenext  potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.   Bill Sloan

The guy told me that it had been fully tested and that it was good.  I took it home to install in my Compaq Portable  OK  Im a little behind in technology .  I already had an MFM controller.  I installed the drive and powered up the system.  I got a post error   1701 .  My controller is a Western Digital WD1002S WX2 Rev. C. As I said above  the drive is a Seagate ST 251. The system is a Compaq Portable  circa 1985 .     Ah  finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this olderstuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8      First problem I can forsee is that the ST 251 will not becompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.      Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non smt chip onthe board.  Slightly below center  and left.    The bios should read either       62 000042 015 or             62 000094 0x2     If the last 3 digits are 013  you got problems.  Controller jumpers are set as follows       represents jumper  	W1	1 2 3        W2      1 2 3 	W3	1 2 	W4	1 2 3 	W5	1 2 3 	W6	1 2 3 	W7	1 2 3    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped  with a trace  betweenpins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. The drive jumpers are as follows    8  represents jumper     Looks right.   art deleted  Here are my questions   1. 	Are the drive and controller compatible w  each other       I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those arewhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you havethe 62 000042 015 rom  set it like this               5        open              6        open                           7        open                      8        open              4        closed              3        closed              2        open              1        open    Note    those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.Top to bottom.    s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3 4  and 8select the first drive setting  drive 0  and pins 1 2 and 7 select thesecond drive  drive 1 .         If you have the 62 000094 rom  its a auto config  and Ill haveto look up how to do it... I dont have the big book right here. 2. 	Are the jumpers on the card drive set correctly       See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are notright.   Also   at the risk of being insulting  make sure the cablesare on right and good. 8 .    On the jumper on the 251  try moving itto the opposite side of the drive.    Its one or the other.        The narrow data cable goes to J2.   Ive thrown it on J3 a fewtimes and banged my head for a day..... 3. 	Is my systems BIOS in need of an upgrade      Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10 27 82.   A quick wayto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter                 d f000 fff5 fffc     the   is the debug prompt        This will return the rom date  if its of any use. Keith Rice      If I oversimplified any of the above  I appologize.     Itsjust hard to know what caliber of person Im talking to. 8 .

WD1004A 27X  feature F300R   Half slot size hard disk           controller  with an ST506 ST412 interface.  It supports 2 RLL           drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built in ROM           BIOS supports non standard drive types  virtual drive           formatting  bad track formatting and dynamic formatting.                    NOTE 1   AT T 6300   The AT T 6300 and the AT T 6300 PLUS           contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.            When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will           not  boot.   To solve this problem  one of the ROM BIOS chips           must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital            XT controller card  you must remove the jumper at position W 3           or add a jumper at position R 23  depending on which model of XT           controller you are using .                                                  2                     NOTE 2   TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS   The WD1002A WX1  WD1004A WX1            WDXT GEN2 and the WD1004 27X can be modified to operate in           Tandy 1000 series computers  models SX  TX and the original or            A  version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2  IRQ2            instead of IRQ5  the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A WX1 or           the WD1002 27X to operate in these systems  you must cut the           etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W 7.  Then           solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position  W 7 .  To complete the           modification  a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S 1            2 rows of 8 pins .  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION           TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY           ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A WX1  WDXT GEN2 or the           WD1004 27X for your Tandy 1000 system  a zero ohm resister must           be soldered to jumper position W 27.  This will change the           interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

BTW   Why the sneer quotes    We  know because the area that the gun shop shooting range is in is right on the border of the west side of Chicago.  That is a gang infested area.So   Kratz was there   does that mean that hes a gang member Even in the most gang infested areas  most of the residents ARE NOTgang members. that only minorities have gangs   Not so.  As far as the quotes are concerned it was totally obvious that they werent just practicing for marksmanship.How was it obvious   Were they not trying to hit the target   Or  doesKratz confuse  marksmanship  with  trying to simulate a post    If so that excludes self defense shooting  but the rest of us understandthat that exclusion would be an error.   It excludes a lot of legit gun games  as well.  dont know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.Sounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how aself defense shooter might well practice.  The only things that actionexcludes are hunting and  like a post  shooting.  Kratz should get outmore often. andy  
Setting up three user accounting system with WFWG,Organization  Nyx  Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math CS dept.Lines  30I am a novice  at best  in working with pc networks  and am in theprocess of planning a small accounting system for a small business.The particular need in this case is for three machines  each in adifferent office of the same building  each having access to aWindows based accounting system.My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of themachines  likely a 486 and two 386s  along with the appropriate Ethernetcards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit  oneadditional user kit will be necessary .  It then seems logical to purchasea simple multi user accounting system  along the lines of DacEasy orM.Y.O.B.  and fire it all up   The 486 will more or less act as server witha report check printer attached to it.Cable runs of 30 40 feet will be necessary for this setup.Well  this all seems too easy to me.

Paul on weekly collections,Lines  15Mark Gregory Foster writes  concerning 1 Corinthians 16 2     The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted   the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the   first day of the week was that this was when they received their   weekly wages.But the ancient Romans did not observe a seven day week.  Unless aman was working for a Jewish employer  he is unlikely to have beenpaid on the first day of a seven day week.

Even after a few drops   paint chips  it is FAR better  than no helmet or a poorly fitting one.  Ive had many scratches   bangs  which have been repaired plus Im still confident of the protection the  helmet will continue to give me.  Only when you actually see depressions                                      or actual cracks  using a magnifying glass  should you consider replacement.     This is not good advice.  A couple of years I was involved in a low speedgetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head  helmeted hit the pavement with a  clunk   leaving a couple of dings and chips in thepaint at the point of impact  but no other visible damage.  I called thehelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way afiberglass shell works is to first give  then delaminate  then crack.This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over awider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing  the crushable foamliner takes care of absorbing  hopefully  the remaining impact force.They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality  delaminationof the glass resin layers  can occur with NO visible signs  either inside oroutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and theywould inspect it  including X raying .  I did so.  They sent back the helmetwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that wouldcompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claimprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them. The bottom line  though  is that it appears that a helmets integritycan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sureis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmetmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another pointto consider when purchasing a lid.

Keith Schneider   Stealth Poster ,Organization  California Institute of Technology  PasadenaLines  26NNTP Posting Host  lloyd.caltech.educmtan iss.nus.sg  Tan Chade Meng   dan  writes  I somewhat agree with u.  However  what it comes to  theist  religion   its a different matter.  Thats because religion is like a drug  once u use it  its very difficult to get out of it.  Thats because in order to experience a religion  u necessarily have to have blind faith  and once u have the blind faith  its very diffcult for you to reason yourself back to atheism again. Therefore  its unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to judge it.  Its like asking people to  try dying to find out what death is like .Well now  we cant judge death until we are dead right   So  why shouldwe judge religion without having experienced it   People have said thatreligion is bad by any account  and that it is in no way useful  etc. but I dont totally agree with this.  Of course  we cannot really sayhow the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.So basically  we can not judge whether religion is the right route fora given individual  or even for a general population.  We can say thatit is not best for us personally  at least  you can choose not to usereligion  might be hard to try to find out its benefits  as you stateabove .keith

Can sin  block  our prayers ,Organization  Kulikauskas homeLines  27mike boulder.snsc.unr.edu  Mike McCormick  writes   Not honoring our wives can cause our prayers to be hindered             You husbands likewise  live with your wives in          an understanding way  as with a weaker vessel           since she is a woman   and grant her honor as          a fellow heir of the grace of life  so that your          prayers may not be hindered.  I Peter 3 7One interpretation Ive heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing ones wife.  The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is Gods will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife.Jayne Kulikauskas  jayne mmalt.guild.org
New Study Out On Gay Percentage,Organization  Optilink Corporation  Petaluma  CALines  61In article  C5K5LC.CyF murdoch.acc.Virginia.EDU   lfoard hopper.Virginia.EDU  Lawrence C. Foard  writes   In article  15378 optilink.com  cramer optilink.COM  Clayton Cramer  writes    From the Santa Rosa  Cal.  Press Democrat  April 15  1993  p. B2           Male sex survey  Gay activity low          A new natonal study on male sexual behavior  the most thorough       examination of American mens sexual practices published since       the Kinsey report more than four decades ago  shows about 2       percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and       1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.          The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday       by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than       the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional       wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.    1  So what Homosexuals lie about the 10  number to hide the disproportionateinvolvement of homosexuals in child molestation.  They also lieabout  10   to keep politicians scared.  2  It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers     gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of     us then this is an event unprecidented in history...But many of the people who will be marching arent homosexuals  butother members of the leftist agenda.   The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.   The median number of sexual partners for all men 20 39 was 7.3.    Dont forget that 25  had 20 or more partners....Not surprising.  Remember  that study includes homosexuals as well.   Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters  Johnson    and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners  it is apparent that   homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general   male population.      And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those  who said they where homosexual  Or is that number to inconvient for  you....It wasnt published.   Its a shame that we dont have a breakdown for   straight men vs. gay bi men    that would show even more dramatically   how much more promiscuous gay bi men are.

quality of Catholic liturgy,Lines  56In  Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313 athos.rutgers.edu jemurray magnus.acs.ohio state.edu  John E Murray  writes  I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately  liturgy  in particular  Catholic liturgy.  In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  Its driving me crazy   The most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together  because we all know how  to do it.  Led by the priest  of course  which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses Ive been to were participatory prayers.  . . .  Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as theCatholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of countingtheir rosary beads during Mass  I find this comment interesting.  Thereis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accountswithout active participation.  If you know the Latin  one reallybeautiful way to hear the Passion is its being chanted by threedeacons   the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range  Jesus chantsin the bass  and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passionthat John would prefer.But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.Each pastor makes his own decisions  it isnt a church wide conspiracyagainst participation .  The Palm Sunday liturgy  with its initialblessing and distribution of the palms and procession  is alreadygetting long before you get to the Passion  some pastors feel that theyshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also  theorchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participationin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single reader proclamation    in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday  it might benecessary to go with the briefer options just to  get em in and get emout .Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied totheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parishin the Columbus area  based on the Ohio State address  has a liturgycloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellowparishioners and see how common your preferences are     pastorsgenerally ARE willing to listen to non confrontational requests.  Thoughyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too stronglyto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasnt followthe continuous evolution model  the accumulation of small changes  nosingle one of which is too hard to take  but rather the punctuatedequilibrium model  things stay the same and we get accustomed to them then the marked mutation hits .   My apologies if I am mis rememberingthe names of the evolutionary theories.

These are   indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by   people around me.I lived there until July 1992 so I think that on the whole my input is relevant.   1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities dont recognize   Israeli nationality   And that ID cards  which Israeli citizens   must carry at all times  identify people as Jews or Arabs  not as   Israelis  Those are two separate questions.  Obviously  Israeli authorities dorecognize Israeli nationality for some purposes  e.g. passports consular services  etc...  ID cards have a field of nationalitywhich is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly  this fieldis provided for sevices provided by the religious departmentsof the govt  though this is not the general case.   2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders   and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to   state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be    From its onset  Israels borders have been shaped and reshaped by bothwar and peace.  As such  the Israeli govt has always felt that definingits borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties havebeen conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for  ultimate borders  is this a game like  ultimate frisbee    extending into  other countries.   3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons   If so    could you provide any evidence  Aside from what Vaanunu provided  no.   4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of   individuals which were tried in secret and for which their   identities  the date of their trial and their imprisonment are   state secrets  If that is true  then by virtue of the questions subject  it isunanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron.That having been said  I deny the above.You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obviousbias.  Questions of the sort  Is it true that you entered yourmothers vagina   which are based upon some kernel of truth  thoughphrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersionsupon Israel.  Incidentally  the answer to the above is usually yes unless you were born via a C section.

Of course if there is some reason why you need toalways know the state of modifiers even if your windows dont have thekeyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the rootwindow.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what havebeen pressed. An even more pointed question  Is there an easy means of making an X keyboard act like a PC keyboard   ie  CapsLock is active  and the user presses shift a  Id like to get a lowercase a instead of A.I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString.You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPressesas you like.

Hunting weapons could be allowed  of course  as long as they are big  and bulky  and require reloading after a few shots  how many times can you shoot at the same animal  anyways One assumes they are moving    First of all lets assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it in to the country  that sounds great  to those that see guns as inherentlyevil  except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someonewho obviously couldnt care less about following the law  after all they got the gun illegally  so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun.Great then everyone with a gun is likely to use it in a crime  nice system.Now  as to reducing the number of guns  coming into society by making it illegal to manufacture  sell  or import them in this coutry   let me usea parallel for empiric evidence.  The amount of cocaine in this country isfar less since its manufacture  sale  and importation was out lawwed.    Ifthat last statement is true then perhaps we should consider your plan.  This could also apply to drugs in general.PLAIN OLD  JOE

60 minutes ,Organization  Bank America Systems Engineering  Pasadena  CALines  20On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend  the lawyers for thefamily of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles SheriffsDepartment had an assessment done of the ranchers property beforethe raid.This strongly implies that the sheriffs department wanted the property any drugs  which were not found  were only an excuse.In Viet Nam  Lt Calley was tried and convicted of murder because histroops  in a war setting  deliberately killed innocent people.

Shea was hospitalized shortly after his selection in February.  He returned yesterday to lead the formal presentation to the independent White House panel. Sheas presentation was rambling and almost inaudible.I missed the presentations given in the morning session  when Shea gavehis  rambling and almost inaudible  presentation   but I did attendthe afternoon session. The meeting was in a small conference room. Thespeaker was wired with a mike  and there were microphones on the table forthe panel members to use. Peons  like me  sat in a foyer outside theconference room  and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV. Ingeneral  the sound system was fair to poor  and some of the otherspeakers  like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency also were  almost inaudible. Shea didnt  lead the formal presentation   in the sense of runningor guiding the presentation. He didnt even attend the afternoonsession. Vest ran the show  President of MIT  the chair of theadvisory panel .   Sheas deputy  former astronaut Bryan OConnor  will take over the effort.Note that OConnor has been running the day to dayoperations of the of the redesign team since Shea got sick  whichwas immediately after the panel was formed .

text of White House announcement and Q As on clipper chip encryption,"Organization  DSG  Stanford University  CA 94305  USALines  94In article  1qmugcINNpu9 gap.caltech.edu  hal cco.caltech.edu  Hal Finney  writes  The key question is whether non Clipper encryption will be made illegal.        The Administration is not saying   since encryption       threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement        we will prohibit it outright   as some countries have       effectively done   nor is the U.S. saying that  everyDoes anyone know what countries are these        American  as a matter of right  is entitled to an       unbreakable commercial encryption product.   There is a       false  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is       an  either or  proposition.  Rather  both concerns can be        and in fact are  harmoniously balanced through a reasoned        balanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper       Chip  and similar encryption techniques.  The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans have the right to Clipper encryption  but not to unbreakable encryption. This implies that  ultimately  non Clipper strong encryption must become illegal.With the following logical consequences	 a  Using any code designed to obscure informatio which is 	    not easily breakable will be illegal  including		 i  Using code words such as   Project P5		 ii  Speaking a language other than English		 iii  Ever refering implicitly to events not known to			everyone  eg			 Hi John. How was last night  		      For all the listener knows  this may be a code for			 Did you pick up the drugs OK last night  		      of be a code for		         OK. We blow up the Pentagon at midnight. 		 iv  Mentioning anything that could not be perfectly		     understood by an average person with no education.		 v  Words with more than one syllable.		 vi  Speaking with a heavy accent that could bemisunderstood		     by people not used to it.		 vii  books with an  Inner meaning ...such		      as  Animal Farm .  As an aside  isnt the language here jarring   All this talk about  harmonious balance  when theyre talking about taking away peoples right to communications privacy  Yes. It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Dennings proposals are coming true.  If the government continues on this course  I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs for disk files and email  as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications  will be distributed only through the  underground .  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy.I have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a messageeg  Meet me at 11 30 to bomb the White House. Bring some dynamite to an apparently  relatively  innoculous message. This messagehere is an example of the output for the above message    . Its shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.It is shockiong that it could happen anywhere.It is shocking that it could happen in a country that has the arrogance to call itself free.What you can do 	 1  Write to your congress person in plain text.	 2  Write to your congress person in encrypted text.		 decrypter optional 	 3  Send some random keystroked to your congressperson	 4  Send some random keystrokes accross the US boundaries 		and keep the spooks busy trying to decode it.	 5  Write your own encryption algorithms.	 6  Dont buy clipper products.P.S. I cant work out why the US government doesnt want to sellthem overseas. After all  they are rather easy for US interests to decode so make a perfect tool for industrial military espionage...lulling anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security. You willnotice that there is NO mention anywhere about safety for non Americans.Disclaimer  My opinions are mine alone  and do not represent anyone elses.I have nothing that I particularly want to hide at the moment...though I consider the rightto be able to use whatever method of coding data I like to be high on mylist of priorities.

Mind Machines ,Summary  Do mind machines work Keywords  mind sleep Light SoundOrganization  Tripos Associates  Inc.Lines  19I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machinesconsist of LED gogles  head phones  and a microprocessor that controls them.They strobe the  closed  eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashingLEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental  but they are available.Ive heard claims that they can induce sleep  and light trance states forrelaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc...I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful The few sources Ive seen are biased  they are selling the things  and afriend who has tried them claims that  every home should have one  .

I read EVERY letter and thought about each one   I got all sorts of responses  from  marry her  to  have nothing ever to do with her again Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer  here is what I havedecided to do.I sent her a letter today. First  i told her that if she was really seriousabout moving away from home to another state that  I would do anything to get you here in NC.  I told her that I tried to find out if there were any new stores planning to be built   but they wouldnt tell me.About her marraige comment  Im not gonna call it a proposal  causeI still dont know if it was a total joke or not  I more or less saidthat  Marry me   Well  get transferred to NC first and then well talk       Hopefully  what i said could be interpreted either way.Needless to say  there has been a lot of praying over this...I have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. Ifshe was dead serious about getting married   I wouldnt do ityet simply b c she is not  as far as I know to this point  a Christian.It just wouldnt work w o God in the marraige as well. I figurethat if God wanrs this to go through  hes kept us in touch for 10 years now   he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen  itwill happen She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so Ill get to see her...and Ill get a letter from her befoe then so I knowmore of what to look forward to.I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tellmy folks until Im totally sure what is going on.I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situationin your prayers..Finally  I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email addressfor one week.

This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy  Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the  er  step function provided when the riders body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the  rider doesnt.  I think its really inspiring how the manufacturers have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the  CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.I dunno  on my old GS1000E the tank seat junction was nice and smooth.But if you were to travel all the way forward  youd collect the toptriple clamp in a sensitive area.

Im curious why you took a beign statement and cross posted it to several  different news groups  including something along the lines of   alt.discrimination.   Exsqueeze me   I saw  your  original post in alt.discrimination. Your post was cross posted to three groups.  My followup was cross posted to two of those three  omitting soc.motss . Now  instead of engaging in meta discussion off the topic  could you answer  the question posed   If your statement is so  beign       you should have no trouble politely responding to a polite query.       Well  I dont think your query was exactly polite  but I will TRY togive you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net  but here it goes.       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From manyof the newspaper  radio  and tv news reports I have seen  this adjective      is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain aboutthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say thatMr. King was a no good black   I do not know Mr. King and would not make thisascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many   most   news people haveused it in the past.      The entire second trial was about race  Ted.  I dont feel compelled todiscuss Mr. Kings racial background  but had Mr. King been white there wouldnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating wouldnot have occurred if he were white  but that is an extremely difficult callto make.  It is possible the case  but not definately.        I still think your actions are crap  Ted.  They are far more divisive thanme using the adjective black in a non derogenory manner.  Would you havebeen happier if I had used African american    If so  then you really arelost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting onepersons net access revoked  and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.     The way you went about this polite inquiry makes me believe it was anything but.

ABOLISH SELECTIVE SERVICE,Organization  University of Colorado  BoulderLines  42muellerm vuse.vanderbilt.edu  Marc Mueller  writes  Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it  he admits it  the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would be inclined to risk any extra exposure on.As a libertarian  with a small l  who voted for Clinton  I think that heshould abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscienceforbade him to go to war in Vietnam  it should forbid him to perpetuatethis system of government sanctioned slavery. Agreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf. The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40  Navy Times  and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class. Politically  General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues  the ECONOMY and choose to stay out of other peoples wars  Iraq  Bosnia  Somalia  we would not be in this fix.  An anyway  couldnt the jobs be replaced byimproving our domestic situation    Im not for continued deficit spending but if Clinton and Congress want to spend  Id rather they improve the infrastructure than fight other peoples wars.  In addition  more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being  required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships. The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a pork happy Congress.A novel idea   Getting away from naval bases  what about refurbishingdecommissioned Air Force bases as airports   This would be SO much cheaperthan building them from the ground up  Denvers new airport is one of the most appalling examples of pork barreling and cronyism I have seen inmy lifetime .  Even if no more airports are needed  Im sure Bill Gatesor Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields  and themoney from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

Is the Bible a closed book of Scripture   Is it okay for us to go around saying  God told me this  and  Jesus told me that    Wouldnt that imply that God is STILL pouring out new revelation to us   I know that some people will feel that is okay  and some will not.  The concept of a closed canon would certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand  an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes. Lets get back to basics.  Canon  from the latin  means a rule.  Ifwe say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.  There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the wordsthat are spoken need to be compared against the rule canon but notadded to the canon.Is new revelation necessary   Topical  current  personal revelationId say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all timesis not necessary as we have that in Scripture.You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak ofitself being open   ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it isclosed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.   Though the conceptof canon is later historically.  Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call that prophecy   Misleading   Wouldnt that be more having to do with knowledge   I know  the gift of knowledge may not be as exciting to talk about  but shouldnt we call a horse a horse  I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy ismeant to bring a  word of the form  the man you live with is not yourhusband  then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture.I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery.The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.Regards David  David Morgan  University of Technology Sydney   morgan socs.uts.edu.au _  _                Po Box 123 Broadway NSW 2007      Ph    61 2 330 1864                         15 73 Broadway Sydney             Fax   61 2 330 1807    _.  ._  I paid good money to get my opinions  you get them for free                 v

Too Many Europeans in NHL,Article I.D.  alchemy.1993Apr6.141557.8864Organization  University of Toronto Chemistry DepartmentLines  77In article  rauser.734062608 sfu.ca  rauser fraser.sfu.ca  Richard John Rauser  writes     Ten years ago  the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992 93 season  the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats   Canadians  400 Americans  100 Europeans  100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off  and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Heres the point  there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team  lets say  the Red Wings and the Canucks  and seeing names like  Bure   Konstantinov  and  Borshevshky . Is this North America or isnt it  Toronto  Detriot  Quebec  and Edmonton are particularly annoying  but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.  From where I come from in Canada  Borshevsky sounds more Canadian thanSmith    Anyways  crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the NBA doesntcare where they get basketball players from  major league baseballdoesnt give a damn where they get baseball players from  except Cuba that is .Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary supplier of players...Sweden  Finland  the Czech Republic  and Slovakiaare all relatively small countries  and cannot really produce playersat a greater rate than they are already producing them  and thepotential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely bluntedbecause the system has been raided and is starved for finances andwill take a decade or two  to recover and become a real threat  andthe US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continueto supply 60  plus of the top hockey players in the world for theforseeable future.Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to takeits rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant worldsports...and since soccer is essentially boring  unlike hockey.     I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about  Pavel Bure  the Russian Rocket  I will completely throw up. As it is now  every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher.  By the way  Im not a Canucks fan to begin with    .       Okay  the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians  and some Americans . It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans  who arent even better hockey players. Its all hype. This  European mystique  is sickening  but until NHL owners get over it  Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating  the problem is clearly only getting worse. Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate if they havent already...and by the time Russia comes online again the NHL should be a world league  and there will be many more teamsto stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the nearteam  the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of Americans  not because of Europeans.     Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League  and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just dont want them on mine. Crawl into a hole and die...   Gerald

Just to be sure  I asked a couple of our technicians  one of whom has been servicing Macs for years. There is  no  danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging ADB devices with the power on.The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector are close to each other  and if you happen to bend thecable a little while inserting it  you short the ADBport.

text of White House announcement and Q As on clipper chip encryption,Organization  National Institute of Standards   TechnologyDistribution  naLines  282Note   This file will also be available via anonymous filetransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory  pub nistnews andvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301 948 5717.                                                                                 THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                           April 16  1993                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYThe President today announced a new initiative that will bringthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.The initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and securetelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.For too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth  privacy andlaw enforcement  previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information  it also can be usedby terrorists  drug dealers  and other criminals.A state of the art microcircuit called the  Clipper Chip  hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation  protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal  state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A  key escrow  system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2 keys   numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured  the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two  key escrow  data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The  Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology  theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition  respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryptions dual edge sword   encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry  but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the  Clipper Chip  and otherapproaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches  like the key escrow system  the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates           the privacy of our citizens  including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes           the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data  under proper court or other legal          order  when necessary to protect our citizens           the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace  and           the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries  the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high speed networks  information superhighways   will transmit video  images  HDTVprogramming  and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure  the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent  comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONSTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ    Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations A    No.   Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message A    They would have to obtain legal authorization  normally a     court order  to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts  which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q    Who will run the key escrow data banks A    The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point  the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key escrow data banks.Q    How strong is the security in the device   How can I be sure     how strong the security is   A    This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system  we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q    Whose decision was it to propose this product A    The National Security Council  the Justice Department  the     Commerce Department  and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President  the Vice President  and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q    Who was consulted   The Congress   Industry A    We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues  and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q    Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A    The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits  but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q    Who provides the  Clipper Chip  A    Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance      California  and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q    How do I buy one of these encryption devices  A    We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the  Clipper Chip  into their devices.     Q    If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed  would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices A    This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure  more convenient  and less expensive     than others readily available today  but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology  which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying   since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement      we will prohibit it outright   as some countries have     effectively done   nor is the U.S. saying that  every     American  as a matter of right  is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.   There is a     false  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is     an  either or  proposition.  Rather  both concerns can be      and in fact are  harmoniously balanced through a reasoned      balanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper     Chip  and similar encryption techniques.Q    What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration   A    It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans     privacy  help businesses to compete  and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q    Will the devices be exportable   Will other devices that use     the government hardware A    Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case by case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind  we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case by case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

It must be real nice to get shafted by  20  100 bucks for the  extra cost of a SCSI drive  then pay another  200  300 for a SCSI controller.Yeah  there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics.And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB  because it runs at8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specificallydesigned to interface directly with the AT ISA bus  Weve seenIDEs come out for EISA  XT ISA  and now even MCA  but at all timesit was a 16 bit standard  running at somewhere near 8 10 Mhz. Whenyou run an IDE off of the VLB  theres no way that youre running itat 33 Mhz  it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI  ESDI  whatever none of them run at CPU speed.The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up toa caching controller. I suspect it would be much  much better toget a software disk cache instead  since you get write caching as well. because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.Ive seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.

It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free    immunizations for poor kids.      Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to   go have it done.  The problem is not the cost  it is the irresponible parents   who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done.  I dont know where YOU live  but this is not the case nationawide. Perhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to  do so  but in my area and most areas where I know people  immunizations cost    .    Nationwide  the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50   but    it is reportedly as low as 10  in some inner city neighborhoods.    I bet more than 10  kids living in such neighborhoods are already     covered by Medicaid.    Here in Massachussets  we have had a universal immunization program     the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing  for many years  two decades  .    Mass immunization rate is 65 .  What about the other 35    I guess    some parents are indeed too ignorant or too lazy   or simply do not     care.    Sorry to shatter your stereotypes.                 In case you havent noticed  Clintonites are pushing a universal health      care ACCESS program.   Access  here means that folks who do not give       a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services      delivered to their doorsteps.

I dont remember the  incidence  but it is something like 1 in 1 000 or 10 000 births.  It is hard  to see how you could handle it at home  and you wouldnt have very much time.    thing you might consider is that peoples risk tradeoffs vary.  I consider  a 1 1 000 risk of loss of a loved one to require considerable effort in  the avoiding.  Mark  you seem to be terrified of the birth processThats ridiculous  and unable to believe that womens bodies are actually designed to do it.They arent designed  they evolved.  And  much as it discomforts us  inhumans a trouble free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain andcranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great great grandfathers had several wives  and we never could figure out which wifehad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great great grandfathers were  by the time they reached their forties  quite prosperousfarmers.  Nonetheless  they lost several wives each to the rigors ofchildbirth  the graveyards in Spencer  Indiana  and Boswell  North Dakota contain quite a few gravestones like  Ida  wf. of Jacob Liptrap  andbaby  May 6  1853.  You wanted to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating  I havedirect experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled up breech birth. and now you want all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal.It isnt always fatal.  But it is often fatal  when it happens out ofreach of adequate help.  More often  it permanently damages ones health.Clearly womens bodies _evolved_ to give birth  I am no believer in divinedesign   however  evolution did not favor trouble free births for humans.   You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles  expose herself to anesthesia and infection  and whatever other  just in case  measures you think are necessary.My  arent we wroth   I havent read a more outrageous straw man attackin months   I can practically see your mouth foam.Were statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  AlthoughI cant produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we lookedthem up  rest assured that we balanced C section risks against other risks.I wouldnt encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearlyindicated  on the other hand  I am opposed  on obvious grounds  to waitinguntil an emergency to give in.And bear this in mind  my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.We talked things over  and I did a lot of the leg work  but the maindecisions were really hers. But I for one am bothered by your continued suggestions  especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first time  that birth is dangerous  even fatal  and that all these unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing it naturally.I dont know of very many home birth advocates  even  that think thata first time mother should have her baby at home. Im no Luddite. Ive had a section. Im planning a hospital birth this time. But for heavens sake  not everyone needs that But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife wasunwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.In view of the intensity of the birth experience  I doubt surroundingshave much importance anyway.  Somehow the values youre advocating seemall lopsided to me  taking risks  even if fairly small  of seriouspermanent harm in order to preserve something that is  after all an esthetic consideration.

18 Israelis murdered in March,"Originator  hasan fangorn.mcrcim.mcgill.eduNntp Posting Host  fangorn.mcrcim.mcgill.eduOrganization  McGill Research Centre for  Intelligent MachinesLines  206Sorry guys for this long article  but in fact it is mostly quotings..In article  FLAX.93Apr6125933 frej.teknikum.uu.se   flax frej.teknikum.uu.se  Jonas Flygare  writes          when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that         the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE          and hence ALL their actions  their courts  their laws are illegitimate on         the ground of occupied territories.                No  I am _not_ neglecting that  Im merely asking you whether the existance       of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals        right         to live  a  as you so eloquently put it  human right. We can get back to the          question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also  you have          not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.            First  my above statement doesnot say that  the existence of israeli citizens      in the WB revoke their right of life  but it says  the israeli occupation      of the WB revoke the right of life for some most its citizens   basically      revokes the right of for its military men . Clearly  occupation is an      undeclared war  during war  attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.       Ok  let me re phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the    Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians  well  if you just waited for 5 more lines you would have read my statement Secondly  surely israeli have human rights  but ...    and if so  why.because they belong to the human race  or do you disagree on that too     From your posting  where you did not directly adress my question  I inferred   that you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the   reason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re  your statement of    occupation  Id like you to define the term  so I dont have to repeat this   drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary.         Secondly  surely israeli have human rights  but they ask their goverment to      protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories  not by further oppressing      Palestinean human rights.      Im sorry  but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.I donot know about you  but it makes full sense to me.Israelis are being killed because Israel is occupying   Let israel withdrawand israeli blood will be saved. It isNOT the palestineans who underminedthe right of life of israelis  but it is israel which occupied and exposed the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967  More generally  the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada and i had previously posted a  long  article about this issue  whom i finishedby an open question Suppose the Intifada stops  What is the motive for Israel to withdraw  donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. Everybody in the world looksand hopes for peace  so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessarybut not sufficient motive.         If a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions  then          tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all             Because not all states are like Israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant.      Oh  ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians  Iraqis and others    Does the name of Hama sound familiar  Or how about the kurds in Iraq and   Turkey     How about the Same in Sweden  Ok  maybe a bit farfetched..  the Russians in   the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia    Do the serbs have any human rights remainaing  according to you As for the Arabian countries  their problems are an Arabian concern. the Arabian people can deal with it themselves  if the west doesnot intervene.As for Serbs  I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS  excuse my languagebut it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself  areNOT humans.

And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem                      The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why   because            any system can solve it.             The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here  all palestine .

I assumed that was obvious  but I wont repeat that          mistake. Now that I have straightened that out  Im eagerly awaiting your          reply.         So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.       i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph .      No  Im agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper    would probably lead to disaster for both parties. If thats what you refer    to as the Israeli solution then so be it.Ok.            Joseph Weitz  administrator responsible for Jewish colonization              said it best when writing in his diary in 1940          	    Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both         	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal         						                                 	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.         	   The only solution is a Palestine  at least Western Palestine  west of         	   the Jordan river  without Arabs.... And there is no other way than         	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries  to         	   transfer all of them  not one village  not one tribe  should be          	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to         	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.

Guess what..  Those are not the people that will      make any lasting peace in the region.  more deleted stuff        Exactly  you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment    is full with  men like Joseph Weitz.       Oh  Have you met with them personally  to read their diaries  Fascinating.   What do you _do_ for a living              We  and  our  either refers to Zionists or Jews  i donot know which .                Well  i can give you an answer  you Master of Wisdom  I will NOT suggest the          imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem                 I think that is fair enough .            No  that is _not_ an answer  since I asked for a system that could solve       the problem. You said any could be used  then you provided a contradiction.         Above you wrote that you understood what i meant  underlined by            any system can be used to solve the conflict   but not any system would       resolve it JUSTLY.      An unjust solution would be a non solution  per definition  no My definition is the same as yours  but one has to look into the world politics.In politics  a  solution  doesNOT imply  JUST solution .   You said the following       For all A it holds that A have property B.   There exists an A such that property B does not hold.      Thus  either or both statements must be false.            Guess where that takes your logic  To never never land.        You are proving yourself as a    . First you understood what i meant  but then    you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic.     Too bad for you  the Master of Wisdom.      I was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning.   Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out   before you started using your statements to prove a point or so.   Am I then to assume you are  not logical It seems that it was problem in the definition of  solution .I think a solution must be just  because otherwise it would never be lasting.However  when politicians say a solution  they donot mean a just solution but just a solution.          The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children .      			    Rabbi Shoham.            Oh  and by the way  let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are      a real bummer  when I try giving your posts any credit.       Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in       if you were a Zionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts      well i feel sorry for you  because the same Rabbi Shoham had said      Yes  Zionism is racism .    If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes  then drop Zionism.    If you are not Zionist  why are you bothered then. You should join me in    condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.      Any quote can be misused  especially when used to stereotype all    individuals by a statement of an individual. If you use the same   methods that you credit Zionists with  then where does that place you       Oh  by the way  Id advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties.   I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman  but Ill try as    long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people.   By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel  the government of Israel     the leaders of Israel  political and or religious  or the jews in   general  If you feel the need to condemn  condemn those responsible   instead. How would you feel if we started condemning you personally   based on the bombings in Egypt       Jonas Flygare  Hasan"

Hate to mess up your point  but it is incredibly easy to learn howto make a nuclear weapon.  The hard part is getting the radioactives toput in it.

Some more about gun control   ,"Nntp Posting Host  fishlab3.fsh.mtu.eduOrganization  Help  my servers fallen  and cant get up  MTU X Newsreader  TIN  version 1.1 PL8 Lines  185In article  C5Bu9M.2K7 ulowell.ulowell.edu jrutledg cs.ulowell.edu  John Lawrence Rutledge  wrote   In article  1q96tpINNpcn gap.caltech.edu  arc cco.caltech.edu   Aaron Ray Clements  writes    The Second Amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms.  Clearly   and unequivocally  without infringement.  Unfortunately the Second Amendment is not as clear as you state.  If last   part of it is taken along  it follows what you have said.  The problem  I have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the  amendment.  The Second Amendment is   	A well regulated militia  being necessary to the security                                  Militia  	of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear                         State  	arms  shall not be infringed.             ArmsYou didnt even get the capitalization correct   Try reading USCA onthe Constitution  or get any other CORRECT version of theConstitution.   This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me.  According  to the Federalist Papers  a well regulated militia has a well defined   structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers      James Madison  Federalist Paper 46   Besides the advantage of    being armed  which the Americans possess over the people of almost    every other nation  the existence of subordinate governments  to    which the people are attached  and by which the militia officers    are appointed  forms a barrier against the enterprises of    ambition  more insurmountable than any which a simple government    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe  which are    carried as far as the public resources will bear  the governments    are afraid to trust the people with arms.                                                 James Madison  I Annals of Congress 434  8 June 1789   The right    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A    well regulated militia  composed of the body of the people                                                                   trained to arms  is the best and most natural defense of a free    country...     Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 29  on the organization of    the militia    Little more can reasonably be aimed at  with    respect to the people at large  than to have them properly armed                                      and equipped  and in order to see that this be not neglected  it    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of    a year.     Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 29  speaking of standing    armies    ... if circumstances should at any time oblige the    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large    body of citizens  little  if at all  inferior to them in                        discipline and the use of arms  who stand ready to defend their                                                                       own rights and those of their fellow citizens.                                                  But  surely  Hamilton and Madison didnt mean the PEOPLE when theysaid  people   right   Thats why the Amendment refers to  the Rightof the Militia  ...       Your average   17 45 year old male does not fall into the definition.Youre right  the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males  andprobably females under current interpretation .   Therefore most  members of The Militia  the one the every gun advocate refers to  are  not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directlyThe Amendment does nor refer to  well organized   it says  wellregulated .  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to checkhow _well regulated_ I am.   mentioned in the amendment.  If this amendment wanted to allow every member of The Militia to keep  and bear arms  why did it specificly mention a  well organized militia    in the SAME SENTENCE as the right to keep and bear arms Correct.  Thats why the Right is reserved to the People.  And thatwas to insure the People could form a  well regulated Militia   not a well organized militia .  It could be  argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last   part.  If so  why was it include in the same atomic unit of writtenWhat do Atomic Units have to do with this argument   Any moron can seth_bar   C   1...  instead of a separate sentence Oh  I see what your question is  Why dont you read the federalistPapers       James Madison  Federalist Paper 41  regarding the  General    Welfare  clause    Nothing is more natural nor common than first    to use a general phrase  and then to explain and qualify it by a    recital of particulars. But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd   Heonly wrote it.  The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with   the security of a free state.  The Federalist Papers mention of a  well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects  the security of a free state.  All these examples are actions of a  very organized force  not some John Q. Public with a gun.Thats obviously because youve never actually  read  the FederalistPapers.   All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me is that the peoples  right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed.  That is   people have the right to join a well organized militia.  This well  organized militia will  of course  provide training in how to use arms  and in basic military tactics.  These training members of the militia  can keep and bear the arms.Cant read  huh   Show me where the document says  well organizedmilitia .   Lastly  reading through the Federalist Papers on well organized   militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias.  One reason stated is the protection from a standing army.  These days  the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every   17 45 year old male and female not in the armied forces.That is  exactly  why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own  any weapon currently in use in the armed forces.  Another  reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need  for a standing army.  Well  the US Armied Forces have been a standing  army for more than half the history of the US.But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.  It seems to me the whole reason for the Second Amendment  to give  the people protection from the US government by guaranteeing that the  people can over through the government if necessary  is a little bit  of an anachronism is this day and age.  Maybe its time to re think  how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately.    Abraham Lincoln  First Inaugural Address  March 4  1861   This    country  with its institutions  belongs to the people who inhabit    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government     they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it  or    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.     Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts  spoken during floor debate    over the Second Amendment  I Annals of Congress at 750  17 August    1789   What  Sir  is the use of a militia   It is to prevent the    establishment of a standing army  the bane of liberty. ...    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of    the people  they always attempt to destroy the militia  in order    to raise an army upon their ruins. So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in  He means to destroyour Liberties and Rights.

I would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that youmentioned.  Even if it were possible  I think it is a bad idea since it smacksreal strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since thatis a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedenthas already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this wouldmake it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision  itmust stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the threemarines and thats how it should stand.Frank  who is still mad  but now somewhat sane                                                                           Frank R.

A New Ballpark in Future ,Expires  Sat  1 May 1993 04 00 00 GMTOrganization  Virginia Commonwealth UniversityKeywords  PhilliesSummary  PhilliesLines  17ATTN  Those who live inthe Philadelphia Metro area...Back in September I was listening to WIP  and I remember the morningguys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversationwas a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new parkwas suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time  the mayor wasoptimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Hasthere been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead  such as thenew convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would benice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leavethe VET and leave it solely to the Eagles  and if thats the case the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium  but thats anotherstory .  I want to see that day comments

Animation with XPutImage   ,"Organization  CSIRO Division of Radiophysics Australia Telescope National FacilityLines  41In article  1993Apr21.165310.14544 dsd.es.com   pmartz dsd.es.com  Paul Martz  writes   In article  1993Apr21.154620.16330 infodev.cam.ac.uk   dcr mail.ast.cam.ac.uk  Derek C. Richardson  writes     Hi  Im new to this group so please bear with me         Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation    of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete  Ive    finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.    I put together a quick test  and Ive found that XPutImage      is considerably slower  factor of 2 on average   than the    Sunview command pw_rop   which moves image data from memory    pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that      1  the X protocol communication is slowing things down  or     2  XPutImage is inefficient...or both     Using XPutImage  your source is maintained by the client and the  destination is maintained by the server  thus you incur the overhead  of transporting through whatever client server communications  mechanism you are using.    Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps   These are maintained by the server  so copying them into a window is  much cheaper.    Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs  or running  in XSynchonize mode.  If you need speed  and your client can run on the same host as the X server   you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server  MIT SHM .  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.  A word of warning  make sure your kernel is configured to support shared  memory. And another word of warning  OpenWindows is slower than the MIT  server.  I have written an imaging tool  using XView for the GUI  by the way  which  yields over 10 frames per second for 512 512 8 bit images  running on a Sparc  IPC  half the cpu grunt of an IPX . This has proved quite sufficient for  animations.				Regards 					Richard Gooch...."

What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is   not dependent on  sophisticated tools    CASE tools  .  However  tools   cannot fix a bad process.  Also  tool support for HAL S  the Shuttle   Language  is somewhat limited.3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated  Level 5  by a NASA team.

Apparently no otherlegal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and thingsstart today.More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozenWeaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside thecourthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read   Who standstrial for the murder of Vicki and  sons name   I forget Weaver    On the evening news she said   I am here protestingbecause I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.I thought we all did.   Nice sound bite  grin  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named  Tim who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge theguy  but he looked like a neo nazi.  He also said heexpected many neo nazis to show up throughout the trial. Tim  had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaverand Harris and the news had footage of a Boise coptelling him to move along or hed arrest.  I dont knowthe finer points of this one.  Perhaps theres a lawagainst political activity within X feet of a courthouseor something  what happenned to the First Amendment    .Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmedan agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicamFILMING THE PROTESTORS   Welcome to the world of Big Brother.Anyhow  Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors toleave because he didnt think it would help Weavers caseany.

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists  why do you follow it blindly         Do the words  Question Authority  mean anything to you       I defy any theist to reply.      Dear Defiant  or Unfaithful or Pixie  I will take up the challenge to reply  as I am a theist.The foundation for faith in God is reason  without which the existenceof God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reasonis indisputable  cf. my short treatise   Traditional Proofs for the Existence of God   and Summa Theologica .Now  given that God exists  and that His existence can be proven by reason I assert that His commands must be followed blindly  although in our fallencondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why Because God is the First Cause of all things  the First Mover of matter the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence  theMeasure of all that is perfect  and the essential Being who gives orderto the universe  logos .I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so  then that which iscontrary to the will of God is evil  i.e.  the absence of the good.  And since God can never contradict Himself  then by His promise of a Savioras early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3 5  God instructs that becausea human  Adam  was first responsible for mans alienation from the Sourceof all good  a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth  John 14 6 .  If this claimis true  then we are bound by reason to follow Him  who is truth incarnate.You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the UnitedStates Marine Corps yet   I can tell you first hand that it is an excellentinstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege  I willreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  Forexample  when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newtons head  he couldhave denied that it happened  but he did not.  The laws of physics mustbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. Therefore  the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.QED    boundaryno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra  no hevenido a traer la paz  sino la guerra  Mateo 10 34  Vulgata Latina

As noted in another thread  Limiting govt   the problem libertarians face  is insuring that the  limited government  they seek does not become the   tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda.     It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any  reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just  as Marxism  fails  to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and  the state is to  wither away   libertarians frequently fail to show how  weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human  condition.		    Patricks example of anti competitive regulations for            auto dealers deleted.  Heres what I see libertarianism offering you  ... This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream  but basic human decency and common sense.  A real grass roots example of freedom and liberty. And yes  not having a few people acting as our masters  approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other  does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.     Thanks awfully               PatrickLet me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  AsIve noted before  Im not necessarily disputing the benefits of eliminating anti competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers barbers  etc.  One need not  however  swallow the entire libertarianagenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits ofallowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his her services withoutregulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   As some many libertarians would argue.   On a case by case basis  the cost benefit ratio of government regulationis obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda  however  does not callfor this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation  of anykind  always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis  but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic  to say the least.I have no objection to an analysis of medical care  education  national defense or local police that suggests a  free market  can providea more effective  efficient means of accomplishing social objectivesthan is provided through  statist  approaches.   With some notableexceptions  however  I do not see such nitty gritty  worthwhile analysis being carried out by self professed libertarians.  jsh  Steve Hendricks                           DOMAIN   steveh thor.ISC BR.COM    One thing about data  it sure does cut   UUCP     ... uunet isc br thor steveh the bulls  t.

I confess I dont know of any   indeed thats why I checked the FAQ to see if it had one   but Im sure some alert reader does.  I think the list of books suffers far too much from being Christian based  I agree that most of the traffic is of this nature  although a few Islamic references might be good  but I still think an overview would be nice.One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religionsis called _Mans Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a classI had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decentbibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.It doesnt  compare  religions directly but describes each one individuallyand notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be evenremotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact  Christianitymercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book isdivided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  India  East Asia  Near East .  There is nothing about New World religionsfrom the Aztecs  Mayas  Incas  etc.  Just the stuff people kill eachother over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out alongthe way.  If you like the old stuff  then a couple of books called  The Ancient NearEast  by James B. Pritchard are pretty cool.  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh Code of Hammurabi  all the stuff from way back when men were gods and godswere men.  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their ownreligion and make it sound real good.
Darrrrrrrrryl,Organization  SAICLines  33In article  mssC5KCru.5Ip netcom.com   mss netcom.com  Mark Singer  writes          The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to   death  but I havent seen anything in rsb yet.      Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two   on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the   right field corner.  The ball cleared the three foot high fence and   went into the crowd.  Darryl  racing over from right center  got to   the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence  but he   missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row  wearing a mitt    reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.      Now Ive seen the replay several times and I have concluded that   Darryl missed the ball  and that the fans glove was essentially   behind Darryls.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate   vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with   Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed  however  is that the fan   who caught the ball never took his eye off it   he was oblivious   to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as   soon as he realized he had made the catch.       Stuff about Daryl and Tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted I saw the replay several times too.  No question about it.  Daryl missedthe ball   then  the fan caught it.  Daryl is so tall that he had thefirst shot at the ball.  Daryls just whining again.  I think it shows alack of class when Tommy  Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan forlosing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point   Sorry  Tommy.If it were a 2 1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall  then maybe  just maybe   youd have an argument.

Appreciate the help.          I dont know if this might help  but Ive just started playing with a program   called POVRay  Persistance of Vision Raytracer  that also displays its output   via X Windows.  It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my   Psuedo Color 8 plane display.  I got the source from from a site in Canda.   The person I retrieved them from was David Buck  dbuck ccs.carleton.ca .   I think the original post was searching for existing implementations off.i. Gouroud shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plainX. Simpler shading models are implemented already  f.i. in x3d  ask archiewhere to get the latest version .For Gouroud  a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extensiononly  either MIT SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the windowwith it  or PEX OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portablevanilla X way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage   what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapesor such stuff.To speak about POVRay  the X previewer that comes with the original sourcepackage is not that good  especially in speed  protocol friendlyness andICCCM compliance.

The    publication was enormously successful  we distributed 2000 copies to    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in    Great Britain  Australia  and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to    the first edition  PPS has published an expanded  up to date second    edition of the guide.    The 40 page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full time job    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of     Space Jobs  features strategies for entering the space field and    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms  NASA  and    non profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia  as    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

Bussard  Journal of	Propulsion and Power  Vol. 6  No. 5  Sept. Oct. 1990	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion	    systems  with propulsion thrust power input power ratio  the	    thrust power  gain  G t   much greater than unity. Gain values	    of conventional  solar  fission  electric propulsion systems are	    always quite small  e.g.  G t  0.8 . With these   high thrust 	    interplanetary flight is not possible  because system	    acceleration  a t   capabilities are always less than the local	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast  gain values 50 100	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts  which offer	     high thrust  flight capability. One performance example shows a	    53.3 day  34.4 powered  18.9 coast   one way transit time with	    19  payload for a single stage Earth Mars vehicle. Another shows	    the potential for high acceleration  a t  0.55g o   flight in	    Earth moon space.

This is an introduction to the application of Bussards version	    of the Farnsworth Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion	    technology to propulsion. 1500 Isp 5000 sec. Farnsworth Hirsch	    demonstrated a 10  10 neutron flux with their device back in	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch  responsible for the	    panic  has recently recanted and is back working on QED.    Jim	    Bowery 	 PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications   by	Paul M. Koloc  Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion	Energy  special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY  March 1989.	    Aneutronic energy  fusion with little or negligible neutron	    flux  requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels  then high power densities	    and very compact  realtively clean burning engines for space and	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm	    innovation will make this possible  its unique pressure	    efficient structure  exceptional stability  fluid mechanically	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the	    multi gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost.  I	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob	    Hirsch  the primary proponent of the Tokamak  has recently	    declared Kolocs PLASMAKtm precursor  the spheromak  to be one	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority  the	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball lightning with solid	    MHD physics.

To the newsgroup at large  how about this for a deal  recognise that what      happened in former Communist Russia has as much bearing on the validity      of atheism as has the doings of sundry theists on the validity of their      theism.  Thats zip  nada  none.  The fallacy is known as ad hominem  and      its an old one. It should be in the Holy FAQ  in the Book of Constructing     a Logical Argument        Apart from not making a lot of sense  this is wrong.   There  is no  atheist creed  that taught any communist what to do  in  the name of atheism .   There clearly are theistic creeds and  instructions on how to act for theists.    They all madly  conflict with one another  but thats another issue.  Lack of instructions on how to act might also be evil.Thats like saying that  since mathematics includes no instructions onhow to act  it is evil.  Atheism is not a moral system  so why shouldit speak of instructions on how to act    Atheism is simply lack ofbelief in God .  Plenty of theists think so.   So one could argue the case for  atheism causes whatever I didnt like about the former USSR  with as much validity as  theism causes genocide    that is to say  no validity at all.I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocidecan be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide.This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.  However  sincethe atheist set of instructions is the null set  how can you show thatatheism causes genocide   David Choweller  davec silicon.csci.csusb.edu There are scores of thousands of human insects who areready at a moments notice to reveal the Will of God onevery possible subject.

Australia.Lines  120In  16BA7103C3.I3150101 dbstu1.rz.tu bs.de  I3150101 dbstu1.rz.tu bs.de  Benedikt Rosenau  writes  In article  1993Apr5.091258.11830 monu6.cc.monash.edu.au  darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au  Fred Rice  writes     Deletion     Of course people say what they think to be the religion  and that this    is not exactly the same coming from different people within the    religion.  There is nothing with there existing different perspectives    within the religion    perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on    the truth.     My point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the meantime.      And that they converge is counterfactual  religions appear to split and   diverge. Even when there might be a True Religion at the core  the layers   above determine what happens in practise  and they are quite inhumane   usually.      What you post then is supposed to be an answer  but I dont see what is has got to do with what I say.   I will repeat it. Religions as are harm people. And religions dont converge  they split. Giving more to disagree upon. And there is a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at all.Ideologies also split  giving more to disagree upon  and may also leadto intolerance.  So do you also oppose all ideologies I dont think your argument is an argument against religion at all  butjust points out the weaknesses of human nature.  Big deletion    2  Do women have souls in Islam     People have said here that some Muslims say that women do not have  souls.  I must admit I have never heard of such a view being held by  Muslims of any era.  I have heard of some Christians of some eras  holding this viewpoint  but not Muslims.  Are you sure you might not be  confusing Christian history with Islamic history    Yes  it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the Turkish Caliphate.I would like a reference if you have got one  for this is news to me.  Anyhow  that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown  from many verses of the Quran.  For example  the Quran says      For Muslim men and women      for believing men and women   for devout men and women   for true men and women   for men and women who are patient and constant   for men and women who humble themselves   for men and women who give in charity   for men and women who fast  and deny themselves    for men and women who guard their chastity   and for men and women who engage much in Gods praise     For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward.      Quran 33 35  Abdullah Yusuf Alis translation     There are other quotes too  but I think the above quote shows that men  and women are spiritual equals  and thus  that women have souls just as  men do  very clearly.     No  it does not. It implies that they have souls  but it does not say they have souls. And it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all interpretations.One must approach the Quran with intelligence.  Any thinking approachto the Quran cannot but interpret the above verse and others like itthat women and men are spiritual equals.I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women havesouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to beforgiven   Or to have a great reward  understood to be in theafter life    I think the usual answer would be no    in which case  thepart saying  For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls.   If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven  then I have no idea _what_ a soul is. As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priorityin all interpretations  any thinking approach to the Quran has to giveall verses of the Quran equal priority.  That is because  according toMuslim belief  the _whole_ Quran is the revelation of God    in fact denying the truth of any part of the Quran is sufficient to beconsidered a disbeliever in Islam. Quite similar to you other post  even when the Quran does not encourage slavery  it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to slavery. It is a non sequitur.Look  any approach to the Quran must be done with intelligence andthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand theQurans message.  In a book of finite length  it cannot explicitlyanswer every question you want to put to it  but through its teachingsit can guide you.  I think  however  that women are the spiritual equalsof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse  and thatsince women can clearly be  forgiven  and  rewarded  they _must_ havesouls  from the above verse .Lets try to understand what the Quran is trying to teach  rather thantry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring thispassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Quran based onignoring this verse or that verse are infinite  but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited.  Lets try to discuss theseinterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people canignore this bit or that bit  for that is just showing how people can tryto twist Islam for their own ends    something I do not deny    butprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.
